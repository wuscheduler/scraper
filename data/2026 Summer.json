Indeed, Baldwin saw himself as a public witness to the situation of black people, compelled to speak truth to power in whatever form he deemed necessary. Baldwin -- as Black, gay, man, American, author, activist, and so much more -- has served as an essential figure in theorizing alterities of the presumed rigidity of these very concepts. In this respect, this course will center Baldwin the thinker as much as Baldwin the author. We will examine his classic novels and essays as well as his work across many less-examined domains: theatre, sermon, dialogue, film, and short story. Moreover, while committing ourselves to close reading methods, we will situate Baldwin's works within the sociohistorical context and consider how he shaped and was shaped by events, beginning with the Civil Rights Era through our precarious contemporary moment in which he remains -- often tragically -- a timely voice.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_3644","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"Look Here, Karen: The Politics of Black Digital Resistance to White Femininity","catalogNumber":"AFAS 3644","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355409","number":"11","term":"2026 Summer 1","instructor":["Lloyd, Raven"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri"],"time":[780,960],"seats":[0,40]}]},"description":"In this course, we will explore the ways in which Black online publics use resistance  strategies, such as mimetic imagery and racial humor, to call attention to white  femininity and its deployment of the police against African Americans.

Over the course of the semester, the students learn how macroscopic observations of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, the properties of elements and compounds, and chemical periodicity developed into the microscopic understanding of molecular structure and bonding. The semester begins with fundamentals related to stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solution chemistry, and gas properties, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving. The octet rule, Lewis structures, and valence-shell-electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory are then introduced as early efforts to describe the stability and structures of molecules. The localized electron model (LEM) and molecular-orbital theory (MOT) are next described as modern descriptions of chemical bonding. The course concludes with intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.

Florence is a place where living culture and deep history overlap—where daily life unfolds within an environment shaped by centuries of architecture, art, and design. Through exploring the city, recording observations, and working across drawing, photography, printmaking, and physical modeling, students engage Florence as a dynamic laboratory for experimentation and discovery. The studio welcomes students from architecture and other fields, offering all participants the opportunity to interpret the city in architectural terms through their own disciplinary lens.While the studio's thematic prompt changes annually, all iterations share core aims: to analyze the city through on-site study; to investigate how place, history, and culture shape the built environment; and to consider how past and future coexist within architectural imagination. Students complete design studies and a final project that synthesizes their research, fieldwork, and creative exploration. Excursions in Florence and across Italy introduce significant examples of contemporary and historical architecture, art, and design. By the end of the course, students produce a cohesive body of work that reflects how the city of Florence in transformation—shaped by its history, inhabited in the present, and imagined for the future.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_590","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Training and Development in Practice","catalogNumber":"ARCH 5990","units":0,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-362574","number":"01","term":"2026 Summer","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Online","time":null,"seats":[0,30]}]},"description":"Training and Development in Practice is a practicum offering students who qualify the opportunity to participate in an internship, or professional immersion experience.
