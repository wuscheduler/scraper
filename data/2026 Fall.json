However, current rhetoric has brought this notion into question. This country has consistently been a magnet for millions of people from all over the world, and this course seeks broadly to understand recent African immigration. In Black studies, most attention has been paid to the forced migration of the enslaved during the Atlantic Slave trade. Studying 20th and 21st African immigration is key to truly understanding the Black experience in America. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.1 million Africans live in America as of 2015. The majority of these migrants are from Sub-Saharan Anglophone Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa), but they are also from war-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The primary focus of this course will be on contemporary African labor immigrants, including skilled professionals, children who arrived in the United States for family reunification, refugees, and winners of the Diversity Visa lottery who are now permanent residents. The migratory flux also includes people who were forced to leave their birth countries for political reasons as well as genocide. Through the class, we will examine the push and pull factors of immigration. The second part of the course explores the lived experience of Africans in America, whether they are well educated as compared with other migrant communities or whether they are laborers. We will study the role of remittances, language barriers, paths to naturalization, and job opportunities once Africans reach American soil. Increasingly, repatriation (both voluntarily and forced), xenophobia and Islamophobia are challenges that rock African immigrant communities. Today, many Africans live between two countries: Africa and America. This transnationalism allows them to navigate different lives, stories, identities, and cultures. Several activities are organized in the African local community. There is a large group of Ghanaians, Kenyans, Egyptians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Ethiopians, and Somalians in St. Louis. We will invite these individuals to the class as guest speakers so that students can fully understand their multiple lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_209B","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"African Studies: Mapping Urban Languages and Resistance in Africa","catalogNumber":"AFAS 2090","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363768","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Mutonya, Mungai"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,30]}]},"description":"This course will introduce students to a variety of approaches to the study of Africa by considering the ways that scholars have understood the African experience.

Of course, a number of black people have run for the presidency as third-party candidates: Frederick Douglass, James Ford, Lenora Fulani, Cynthia McKinney, Angela Davis, and Eldridge Cleaver, among others. In addition, some have sought the Republican Party's nomination as conservatives, such as Alan Keyes, Herman Cain, and Ben Carson. Some of these individuals will be briefly discussed, but time will not permit us to study them. We are fortunate that Dick Gregory and Shirley Chisholm wrote firsthand accounts of their campaigns. We will then move on to the heart of the course: an examination of United States Senator from Illinois Barack Obama's successful campaign for presidency as the first black nominee of a major party.  We will consider his career before he became president, and we will examine certain aspects of his presidency itself.

Often marginalized in both the scholarship and the popular memory, there exists a long unbroken chain of women who have organized around the principles of anti-sexism, anti-racism, and anti-capitalism.

Remaining cognizant of the fact that Black Feminist thought has also flourished as an academic enterprise -- complete with its own theoretical interventions (e.g., standpoint theory, intersectionality, dissemblance) and competing scholarly agendas -- this course will think through the project of Black Feminism as a social movement driven by activism and vigorous political action for social change. Focusing on grassroots efforts at organizing, movement building, consciousness raising, policy reform, and political mobilization, this course will center Black Feminists who explicitly embraced a critical posture toward capitalism as an untenable social order.

Who would write their name all over a city? Why would you stop in the middle of a protest to paint a wall? Is spray paint dangerous? This class will address these questions and more by examining the significance of graffiti as a cultural practice. It will consider the historical context of graffiti’s emergence from the urban ruin of New York City in the 1970s, as well as the social dynamics that have driven the practice of graffiti into the heart of recent uprisings and revolts, from Cairo to Istanbul to Santiago to Minneapolis. Graffiti is considered by some to be art, by others to be criminal vandalism. What happens if we consider it as both, or, even better, as neither? What if we consider graffiti as a kind of monument, or as a kind of political discourse? In such a way, we might begin to see how a cultural practice like graffiti expresses a desire to change the world, and that the form in which such desire is expressed matters as much as its content. This semester we will read accounts directly from graffiti writers themselves, as well as studies of and reactions to major and minor moments and figures over the course of graffiti’s emergence and development. We will be guided in our work by theories of Black culture, study and struggle, and grapple with these theories’ relation to the history of racial capitalism.

By 2050 this number is expected to triple to 1.23 billion or what will then be sixty percent of the continent's total population. This urban growth is happening alongside rapid economic expansion, technological innovations, and-in some cities-political insurrection. Many of these developments are taking place in peripheral urban areas that lack formal planning, basic infrastructure, and security.  Yet, as many theorists point out, the very lack of cohesive planning and stable infrastructure in urban Africa has produced flexible spaces where novel forms of dwelling, work, and leisure are possible. Many residents, often by necessity, rearrange their built environments to make the city function beyond the limits of its original design. In the process, urban dwellers produce new built spaces, aesthetics, and economic practices, calling into question assumptions about what a city is and how it works. What are the implications of Africa's urban revolution for both the people who inhabit these cities and the world at large? How will Africa's urban future shape what some theorists are calling the African century? What can contemporary cities across the continent tell us about the future of urban life everywhere? In this seminar, we will explore these questions by surveying a variety of case studies and topics from across the African continent. The purpose in focusing on Africa in general is not to homogenize an incredibly diverse continent, but to make connections across a variety of different contexts in order to explore conceptual debates and assemble a theoretical tool-kit that is useful for grappling with themes that are simultaneously abstract and concrete.

How can research translate into opportunities beyond the classroom, from service to politics?

Through reflection and writing students develop a stronger intellectual identity, and consider how their research prepares them to participate in conversations and activities that transcend scholarship. This participation is a kind of academic citizenship with students leveraging their learning to engage intellectual, social, and political life in and beyond campus. Students do this primarily through consideration of their capstone research, happening concurrently in the AMCS Capstone Workshop or in an approved seminar. While encouraging Majors to consider the intersection of their academic and personal goals, the workshop supports research (e.g., guest faculty discuss methodology), gives structure to activities already required for the Major (e.g., the capstone abstract), and builds community (e.g., peer-led discussions).

Ta-Nehisi Coates, Roxane Gay, Jia Tolentino, Anne Helen Petersen, Jo Livingstone, Hanif Abdurraqib-at their best, writers like these aspire to the sort of indispensability on political, social, and artistic matters that their forebears like Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, and James Baldwin had at midcentury. But these voices are unique because they emerged through and alongside a specifically online critical sphere, a space betwixt and between the comments section and the little magazine.

However, the story of how they got that way is too often assumed to be straightforward and self-evident. In this course, we will complicate such assumptions by examining the complex cultural web of American sports history and exploring the people, power structures, and social contexts in which our athletic games have developed, from the Civil War to the present. We will pay particular attention to matters of gender and race in traversing these histories, and students will be asked to consider the ramifications of sociocultural development in sports for American culture at large (and vice versa). Among the topics in sport that we will consider in detail are amateurism, commercialization, masculinity, mass mediation, and violence. We will analyze particular athletes of significance from the last 150 years, including Jack Johnson, Althea Gibson, Muhammad Ali, Serena Williams, Michael Jordan, and others. At the same time, we will examine the forms of media that shape our narratives and understandings of the competitions we consume. In addition, we will consider transnational competitions like the Olympics, which bring American conflicts over race and gender into a global context. No prior sports knowledge is necessary to enroll in the class. Students put themselves on the waitlist and will be enrolled manually by the registrar. Five seats are reserved for each class year for a total of 20 students. This course is affiliated with Sports & Society: Culture, Power, and Identity, an American Culture Studies program initiative focused on the intersections of athletics, identity, and social power.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-62826","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"The Real and Fake: Methods of Identity and Racial Formation in Asian American Literatures","catalogNumber":"AAS 3300","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-365441","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Ghosh, Sabnam"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,25]}]},"description":"The Frank Chin and Maxine Hong Kingston “pen wars” of the 1970’s gave rise to the language of“Real and Fake” Asians in the 1970’s. Ever since, this rhetoric has helped articulate conflicting and dissonant realities of Asian American presence in the Americas. So, who is a “real” Asian and who is“fake”? Why do stereotypes like “banana” and “coconut” exist alongside “model minority”? Is cultural identity real or are we just performing certain identities to fit into social positions? How do we study conflicting racial and identarian positions? What methodologies do we use to study the varying intersections of race and identity in Asian American Studies? This course will address these identarian questions that shape Asian American Literatures. This course will utilize the method of the “real and Fake” to question histories and political attachments that has shaped contemporary conflicting Asian American discourses, such as the conflict over affirmative action and the rise of the Asian American conservative right wing. Overall, the course asks, can the “real and the Fake” operate as a method ofhistorical and literary critique? How do we unpack cis-genderism, heterosexuality, white supremacy, racialization through the “Real and the Fake”? On the contrary, how are contemporary discourses of Asian American hypermodernity, cyborgs, virtual reality, desirability shaped by the “Real and Fake” quality of Asian American racial and identarian discourses? Through these questions the course urges students to come up with their own methodological approaches that participate, intervene, and disrupt the project of the “Real and Fake” construction.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_220","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Topics in AMCS","catalogNumber":"AMCS 2200","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-360704","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Familia, Yafrainy"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,16]}]},"description":"This course introduces students to the different approaches and methodologies within the American Culture Studies field, including those represented by literature, history, sociology, and political science; at the same time, will learn key concepts within the field that will inform their future work.

Whether it's brushing your teeth, checking your e-mail, or taking the bus, you use infrastructures regularly. Yet people pay little attention to them-until they break down. From the inconvenience of your bus being late to the emergency of deadly power outages or floods, infrastructures are vital. This seminar is an anthropological study of infrastructure's role in governance, livelihood, sociality, & cultural meaning in urban life. By looking at different forms of and experiences with infrastructure around the world, we will discuss varying understandings of infrastructure, theorize what it does, and analyze its politics. We begin by drawing from anthropology, political theory, and science & technology studies to think about what studying infrastructure entails; thereafter, the course centers on anthropological engagements with infrastructure in the Global South to rethink what infrastructure is and does. Throughout, weekly writing exercises will hone observational, methodological, and writing skills while pushing students to think about infrastructure and daily life in new ways through experiences on campus and in St. Louis.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_4104","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Topics in Anthropology:","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4104","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356374","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Olson, Kyle Gregory"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"A course covering topics in one of the three subdisciplines of anthropology","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_4107","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Topics in Archaeology: Archaeology of the Living World","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4107","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356461","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Baitzel, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"As anthropologists, archaeologists are familiar with the animate nature of reality as experienced by most people at most times in human history.

In spite of focused research efforts, cancer still poses a unique biomedical puzzle as it is now recognized that cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of many disorders with underlying mechanistic complexities that can affect most tissues in the human body. This interactive 1st-semester course provides an introductory overview of the biology of human cancers. We touch upon background topics in DNA structure and replication, gene regulation and transcription, protein synthesis, mutations and DNA repair, but the primary focus is on the genetic and molecular changes that normal cells undergo during transformation into malignant tumors. Part I highlights the first three (of eight) central characteristics of cancer (known as the hallmarks of cancer) - sustained proliferation, evasion of growth suppression, and replicative immortality. The course is a mix of lectures, student-led discussions/presentations, and activities. Lectures provide an overview of each topic, while activities and discussions of cutting-edge oncology topics in the news and primary literature familiarize students with current trends in cancer research as well as enhance reading and critical analysis skills.

Over the course of the semester, the students learn how macroscopic observations of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, the properties of elements and compounds, and chemical periodicity developed into the microscopic understanding of molecular structure and bonding. The semester begins with fundamentals related to stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solution chemistry, and gas properties, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving. The octet rule, Lewis structures, and valence-shell-electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory are then introduced as early efforts to describe the stability and structures of molecules. The localized electron model (LEM) and molecular-orbital theory (MOT) are next described as modern descriptions of chemical bonding. The course concludes with intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This course will be a serious introductory series that requires and develops algebraic-computation and problem-solving skills.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CHEM_590","school":"Arts &

The first third of the course will introduce students to the necessary historical background for this tumultuous period and to relevant topics inRoman political and social life. After this introduction, students will engage directly with the Second Triumviral period through a roleplay game (Memento Romane Regere) designed to simulate the decisions faced by individual Romans and important Roman allies during this period. In the process of developing their characters’ political, military, and social careers, students will investigate the followingquestions: was Rome’s transition from cooperative to autocratic government inevitable; how did Roman social, military, and political systems interact; what was the role that personal relationships played in determining political outcomes; how did Romans negotiate political and social differences; and finally, how were the experiences of living through this difficult time period determined by an individual’s identity?

How might your taste in potato chips relate to your choice in winter coat? How does writing itself contribute to larger cultural conversations? This course will explore how our choices as consumers, creators, and writers are mediated by broader cultural forces such as foodways, fashion, music, advertisement, art, and social media. \"Commodity culture\" refers to what aspects of culture can be evaluated in terms of supposed \"worth\" or economic value. Here students will think critically, draft, take risks, and revise to present work that has been elevated to college-level writing and argumentation. Readings will explore a range of rigorous scholarship and multimedia texts -- whether it's the importance of cultural capital in college admissions, the role of social media in the rise of self-branding, recognizing accessibility in our known environment, Taylor Swift’s connection to “rainbow capitalism,” or the blurred line between high art and  Instagram. As avid readers and writers, we will delve into the details of rhetorical context to approach both published media and our own essays as instances of cultural production. No prior knowledge of foodways, art history, or media studies is necessary for this course, but students are expected to develop a nuanced appreciation of how something as seemingly innocuous as cultural output intersects with larger structures of status, power, and social justice. THIS COURSE SATISFIES THE FIRST-YEAR WRITING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DIVISIONS.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CWP_118","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Writing Program","title":"College Writing: Technology & Selfhood","catalogNumber":"CWP 1508","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363615","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[720,770],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363541","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[780,830],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363625","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[840,890],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363626","number":"04","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363627","number":"05","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363605","number":"06","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363636","number":"07","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363637","number":"08","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363542","number":"09","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"Writing is a technology that allows one to read the thoughts of others across space and time. Our course's theme -- technology -- is the subject matter that we will be reading to hone skills such as analysis, argumentation, and critical thinking. This does not mean that a student must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform a student into one. Rather, this course treats technology in its broadest sense, from its root in the Greek techne (which means craftsmanship, craft, art, or rhetoric) to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology, we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays, we will address responsible uses of technology and the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and we will try to answer questions like the following: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? What roles do we want it to play in our future?

Where possible, we will focus on practical, applied work with sources, which should provide a good foundation for advanced research and writing in your discipline, and we'll give some thought to the different methods by which different audiences and scholarly disciplines select, analyze, evaluate, incorporate, and document the works of others.  Along the way, we will attend to the relationship between different kinds of research projects and the types of sources that suit them, and we'll practice techniques for drawing on the ideas and writings of others in responsible and engaged ways.  Finally, we will grapple with the subtleties and complexities of Academic Integrity, attempting to understand not only the principles that govern responsible research but also the assumptions that underlie them.

Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest. The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course. The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing. For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work. The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals). Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims. The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions. Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments. The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods. The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods. Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses.

In considering topics familiar to advanced economics students, we'll demonstrate how ABMs complement the mathematical approach to modeling emphasized elsewhere in the curriculum.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ECON_4151","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Economics","title":"Applied Econometrics","catalogNumber":"ECON 4151","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-357434","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Canon, Maria Eugenia"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"Introduction to econometrics as it is applied in microeconomics.

We will study how forces -- such as de facto segregation, the disproportionate hyper-disciplining of students, punitive school climates, and the devaluing of certain forms of cultural and social capital -- can contribute to cycles of social reproduction among the marginalized. To address such challenges, this course introduces sociocultural theories and critical qualitative inquiry methods as mechanisms by which urban educational institutions can be positively transformed. Specifically, restorative practices, cogenerative dialogues, and participatory/co-researcher models are explored as methods that honor the voices of marginalized stakeholders and lead to catalytic, transformational impact. Leaving this course, students will have an understanding of the inequitable terrain of urban education institutions as well as a repertoire of theories and methods to assist with the conducting of critically grounded, culturally responsive, humane, and transformative research. In addition to lectures, readings, discussions, films, and actual classroom footage, students will conduct a school experience project to practice using the theories and methods introduced in this course.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence.

In this course, we will examine, from a writerly perspective, the nature of that divide. Is it merited? Are science fiction and fantasy stories so fundamentally different in their construction from their conventional counterparts as to require a radically different approach, and if so, what unique devices do writers of imaginative fiction employ to set their stories apart? Our guide in this exploration will be Jeff Vandermeer's Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction, which we will be considering not just as an instruction manual, but as a representative text. How does Wonderbook -- in its content, construction, and conceit -- differ from more standard writing reference books? How is it similar? In what ways does Vandermeer's guide embody its subject matter? To aid us in this examination, we will be considering contemporary science fiction and fantasy stories by writers on both sides of the genre fence. The purpose of our reading is generative as well as illustrative. We seek to employ what we learn. There will be multiple writing exercises building towards a ten-to-twenty-page science fiction or fantasy story. As a final project, students will submit their collected writings as part of their own Wonderbook.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 5999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356415","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356412","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356410","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"A detailed prospectus approved by a faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student's work must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_400","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 4999","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356843","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356841","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356838","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is for independent study in English Literature.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_300I","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"WRITING 3999","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356847","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Arch, Jennifer"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,2]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356839","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356837","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This independent study in creative writing is for students who have taken the 200-level introductory course in the genre they want to focus on with the instructor.

In this class, we will focus on explicitly political writing by writers who are not politicians, that is to say, sanctioned experts in the affairs of the polis. Foregoing public policy memoranda and economic analyses, we will look at how journalists, grassroots organizers, and creative writers have consciously written to intervene in the affairs of their communities despite their outsider status.

That novel eventually established Robinson at the Iowa Writers Workshop where she taught for many years. What many noticed in her first book was a new sort of voice, a lyric prose, which returned over two decades later in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel \"Gilead\" (2004). Since then, she has written two more novels (\"Home\" and \"Lila\") set in the same town, but with radically different voices and perspectives. Between these novels and her collected essays, Robinson's work engages issues of race, gender, history, regionalism, and religion. Her later work has focused in particular on the role of the humanities and higher education. She has been a lecturer in high demand (appearing at Wash U in November 2018), and she has been interviewed many times-most noticeably by Barack Obama for \"The New York Review of Books.\" In this class, we will read all her published books, asking questions of development, style, and voice. Meanwhile, as we see what critical engagements have been made with her writings, we will situate her within broader academic discourses (like feminist studies, critical race theory, or religion and literature), and ask how various approaches can open new insights into her writings. In this class students will write both a personal essay (responding to an essay of Robinson's) and a critical seminar paper engaging any topic raised by her work.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_599","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Seminar: Teaching Freshman Composition","catalogNumber":"WRITING 5990","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359382","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Monahan, Peter F","Gregory, Meg"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,10]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_3991","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Senior Research Seminar I","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3891","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356844","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Batten, Guinn"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[960,1100],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"This course is tailored to the needs of students who are pursuing honors in English in their senior year.

The Reed-Kellogg system of diagramming is a method of learning grammar by creating pictures, or maps, of sentences. These pictures show the logical relations between words, phrases, and clauses, and they illustrate the choices writers are making as they craft individual sentences. Using a recent textbook by Eugene Moutoux, we will learn to diagram sentences both famous and ordinary, both contemporary and of historical interest. Our aims will be (1) to learn both the rules and the peculiarities of English grammar, (2) to understand how the structure of a sentence can influence its meaning, and (3) to use this knowledge productively in crafting and revising our own prose. By the end of the course, students should be able to diagram just about any sentence in English, whatever the genre or time period, including their own.

Yet, the proliferation of borders-geographical, legal, and symbolic-radically troubles these idealistic accounts of inclusivity and progress. This course grapples with a range of global Anglophone literatures to explore the dark underside of globalization, minding the unevenness and violences of its histories and structures. Particularly, we will work through a set of literary and theoretical texts to investigate the role of literature and literary criticism in reproducing, complicating, and transforming the very conditions of the \"global.\" Following the routes and historical legacies of colonialism and postcoloniality that structure the modern world, our participation in larger academic conversations will be guided by the following inquiries: How do literary and cultural productions not only reflect, but also produce and uphold the very contours of globalization? How do the proliferation of borders, histories of colonialism, and structures of violence trouble celebratory visions of an increasingly interconnected world?

From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's The Human Stain, Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections) and popular films (Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing and The Cohen brothers' The Big Lebowski) to the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_314","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Topics In Literature","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3113","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-362160","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["DeWitt, Rachael"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"Topics In 20th Century and Later Literature will vary by semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_315","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Topics in Literature","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3114","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-362218","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Shipe, Matthew A."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"Topics: themes, formal problems, literary genres, special subjects (e.g., the American West, American autobiographical writing).

Yet while writers and artists set out with a purpose-a clear vision and intention-those motives may change or evolve throughout the creative process. In Bird by Bird, for instance, Anne Lamott likens the writing process to \"watching a Polaroid develop.\" As a writer, she claims, \"[y]ou can't-and, in fact, you're not supposed to-know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing.\" It is only after \"the portrait comes into focus, [that] you begin to notice all the props surrounding these people, and you begin to understand how props define us and comfort us, and show us what we value and what we need, and who we think we are.\" Likewise, in At Work, Annie Leibovitz recalls staging the portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in \"their apartment in the Dakota early in December\" of 1980. Initially, Leibovitz had a clear vision and mission in mind; she conceived of the photo as a moment of stolen intimacy: \"a simple kiss in a jaded time.\" But everything changed in an instant-in the blink of an eye. That night, Lennon was shot and killed while returning to the Dakota. In retrospect, recounts Leibovitz, the portrait \"looks like a last kiss.\" This is a course about stories and storytelling. What stories do we tell and what stories are we told?? How does art (written, visual, and performative) enable us to share our experiences-to bring purpose and meaning to our lives and to the lives of others? Throughout this course, we will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a broad range of discourse communities, including (but not limited to) art history, sociology, psychology, film studies, and cultural studies. We will read, write, and share (both instructor and students) expository prose (personal, persuasive, and interpretative) to consider our perception of and place within the visual world. This course does not count toward the Creative Writing Concentration.

The paradoxical pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet has real-world consequences: from climate change to increasing income inequality to stagnant and declining quality of life for most of us to the ongoing mass extinction of species not deemed economically useful to us, but whose loss simplifies ecosystems to the point of collapse. If these trends continue, we will face very difficult times ecologically and socio-politically. One alternative to infinite-planet economic theory is Ecological Economics, which can be described as economics as if the laws of thermodynamics are true and apply to us. Alone among disciplines with aspiration to analytic rigor, the field of economics has remained unaffected by the thermodynamic revolution that transformed the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, even history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This failure to take physical law into account is one great source of our society's environmental (and social, and political) problems. Ecological economics thus represents the continuation of the thermodynamic revolution begun in the 1880s. This course is designed to give you an appropriate grounding in the fundamental assumptions, the conceptual novelties, and the distinctive tools of analysis that comprise this emergent school of economic theory, while placing this theorizing in historical and ecological context. We'll pay particular attention to how the precepts and practice of Ecological Economics illuminate the largest challenge facing humans today, the necessity of developing an ecologically sustainable society, one that is sized to the limits of our finite planet.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_110","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Environmental Issues","catalogNumber":"ENST 1150","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359827","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[0,60]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359813","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,60]}]},"description":"This course examines the science behind current environmental issues, with emphasis on Ecology and Conservation.

The main outcome of the course is a completed literature review and a well-defined, researchable question on a topic of your choice. Before beginning a study, researchers must develop a compelling and meaningful research question. This question should be grounded in existing knowledge, informed by prior research, and justified by gaps in our current understanding. Researchers communicate this rationale through a literature review, which serves to contextualize, justify, and motivate their research. Writing and revising a literature review is a key part of this process, as the act of writing helps clarify and refine your thinking. Class topics include advanced database searching, evaluating the quality and types of sources, summarizing and analyzing literature, constructing logical and persuasive argu  ments, managing references and data, visualizing information, writing with clarity and style, and using generative AI as a tool for research and writing.

To ward off that fear, we assess the state of the world in the most dramatically pessimistic ways to indicate the seriousness of our situation and our personal commitment to environmentalism.  Highlighting (much less admiring) human progress in areas where solid evidence of its flourishing exists, seems blasphemous, dismissive of evident, copious human suffering and natural systems abuse.  However, the absence of acknowledging human progress reinforces social fear and a sense of danger.  The resulting panic leads to a preferencing of solutions which appear in harmony with nature,  limiting our understanding and trust of viable alternative solutions using our best social, economic and technological powers.

Through the lenses of business, policy, and engineering, students in RESET will learn through classroom lectures from faculty, industry professionals, and policy-makers; group discussions; field trips to solar arrays and a landfill gas power plant; and a final team project where students serve as consultants to a local government, proposing an on-site solar strategy, local policy changes to support decarbonization, and more. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of many large-scale issues influencing decarbonization, as well as the real-world factors that are necessary for designing, financing, and building new renewable energy projects.    Why renewables and the grid? Decarbonizing the electric grid paired with electrifying sectors that currently run on fossil fuels - including transportation, heating, buildings, and manufacturing and construction - together have the potential to reduce more than 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The global energy transition, which was already well-underway, accelerated in 2022 due to a combination of countries' energy security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expanding climate ambition resulting in new policies that support renewable energy, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States.

It consists of professional experience that brings to bear academic knowledge and skills associated with the graduate study of moving image media (film, television, digital).  The practicum may take a number of forms, but in every case, the experience must be planned in a way that contributes to the student's professional development.  It might consist of work curating films for a screening or mini-festival accompanied by screening notes or other activities that enhance the academic value of the event.  The student might organize a reading group or a scholarly symposium or lecture series to further the understanding of a particular aspect of the moving image on campus. The practicum may also consist of archival, or curatorial work in forms of the moving image at an archive, museum, or other non-profit organization (such as the St. Louis International Film Festival). The student might also pursue a film/media-centered oral history project or develop a film/media-centered blog or engage in other forms of writing that have a public presence.  Students may initiate other projects, but any practicum requires a faculty mentor and in circumstances in which there is a collaborating organization, a letter of endorsement of the practicum from the student's on-site supervisor.  Every student presents a written proposal/plan for any practicum to the DGS and to the faculty mentor/advisor.  Both faculty must give permission to the plan and determine the appropriate number of credit hours (variable 1 to 3).  Students may sign up for the practicum more than once to satisfy the 3 credits required in this area for the FMS master's degree; however, only one practicum should be pursued in a given semester. If there is a site supervisor, she/he must provide a letter upon completion of the practicum detailing the student's work and its quality. The student must provide a brief narrative (2 to 5 pages) detailing how the practicum served as a learning experience.  The faculty advisor will award the grade for the practicum.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_FILM_5423","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Film and Media Studies","title":"Histories of Media Convergence","catalogNumber":"FILM 5423","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-357997","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Moralde, Oscar"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,20]}],"lab":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-357996","number":"A","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Moralde, Oscar"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[1140,1320],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"Entertainment and communications forms combine and blend, and they have done so across millennia.

In particular, it surveys many government institutions, agencies, and departments, colorful (and dull) personalities, numerous policies, treaties and agreements, and a plethora of key events that have shaped US foreign relations over time. Primarily a course diplomatic history that examines American statecraft through government to government relations, the course reveals how political, economic and military events, especially wars, have influenced policy and determined outcomes. Along the way, we will also explore major themes such as republicanism, empire, liberty, and independence, as well as chestnuts of grand strategy such as isolationism vs. engagement, realism vs. liberalism, unilateral vs. multilateralism, soft vs. hard power, and idealism vs. pragmatism.

However, new hybrid forms of writing-from historical fiction, to docudramas, to fictionalized biographies-have led to the blurring of the boundary and encouraged the claim that history itself is just another form of fiction. At the same time, historical novelists have placed increasing emphasis on the authenticity, sometimes even the accuracy, of their narratives and characterizations. And further still, contemporary writers are challenging dominant historical narratives by creating plausible fictions from the perspectives of the subordinated, the marginalized and the disenfranchised: plebeians, women, and indigenous, enslaved, and diasporic peoples. As historical novels become ever more popular, the distinction between history and fiction appears to be collapsing before our eyes. Through reading and discussing some outstanding examples of the genre of historical fiction published between the early nineteenth and the early twenty-first century (from Walter Scott to Charles Dickens, from Toni Morrison to Amitav Ghosh, from Graham Swift to Hilary Mantel), this course will investigate whether history is 'factual' or just another form of fiction; whether the appeal of historical fiction should lie in its authenticity; whether the recent success of historical novels should be viewed as a new development, or rather, as a revival of an older literary tradition; and whether novelists and dramatists are more adept than historians at interrogating issues of memory, identity, and change.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-61975","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Historical Methods – Modern Transregional History","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3385","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363418","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Kuzuoglu, Ulug"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"This is a small-group reading course in which students are introduced to the skills essential to the historian's craft.

In the post-Roman world of the West we will read about the Anglo-Saxons, the Carolingians, and the Vikings.

Western civilization may be characterized as one long debate on the holy. In no other civilization did this debate about the limits of the sacred and the profane -- this constant effort at trying to grasp the divine through word and deed -- last continuously for more than 5000 years. To argue over the holy is to argue over the very nature of how to live a life, from the most mundane daily activity to the most sublime act of the imagination. It is to argue over how politics, economics, art, philosophy, literature, and religion are realized in a society. Apart from many types of polytheism, we study the three great world monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We study the ancient cultures of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the empires of Alexander the Great and imperial Rome, the Christianization of the Roman Empire and the rise of Islam, the early medieval world in the North Sea and the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople, the formation of Latin Christendom and the papal monarchy, the Crusades and the reaction of the Islamic lands, concepts of individuality, the persecution of Jews and heretics, chivalry and peasant servitude, the Mongol Empire, the Black Death and the devastation of the 14th century, the Renaissance in Italy and the Protestant reformation, the hunt for witches and the scientific revolution, and the medieval origins of the African diaspora and the European conquest of the Americas. What defined being human -- and so a man, a woman, or a child -- over five millennia? Fundamental questions of this course include the following: What is Western civilization? When do the characteristics defined as Western come together as a coherent phenomenon? What, then, is historical truth?

It addresses slavery as a discourse and a question of political economy. We begin with an overview of slavery in late antiquity to contextualize the evolution of this practice after the rise of Islam in the region. We then examine how it was practiced, imagined, and studied under major empires, such as the Umayyads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Mamluks, the Ottomans, and the Safavids. In addition to examining the Qur'anic discourse and early Islamic practices of slavery, to monitor change over time we address various forms of household, field, and military slavery as well as the remarkable phenomenon of slave dynasties following a chronological order. We discuss, through primary sources, theoretical, religious, and moral debates and positions on slavery, including religious scriptures, prophetic traditions, religious law, and a plethora of narratives from a range of genres. We highlight a distinct theme each week to focus on until we conclude our discussion with the abolition of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries. Topics of discussion include various forms of male and female slavery, Qur'anic and prophetic discourse on slavery, legal and moral views on slavery, slavery as represented in religious literature, political, military, and economic structures of slavery, issues of race and gender as well as slave writings to reflect on the experiences of slavery from within. The goal is to enable students to understand the histories of slavery in the Middle East and eventually compare it to that of other regions and cultures, such as European and Atlantic slavery.

Languages analyzed in detail include Klingon, Esperanto, Heptapod B, Lojban, Dothraki, Valyrian, Elvish, and various philosophical languages.  This class is only open to first-year students.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_LING_170D","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Linguistics","title":"Introduction to Linguistics","catalogNumber":"LING 1600","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359408","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Hyde, Brett D."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,50]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359389","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Hollenbaugh, Ian"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,50]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359338","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Van Engen, Kristin J"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,50]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363474","number":"04","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Barros, Matt"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,45]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363413","number":"05","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Barros, Matt"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,45]}]},"description":"Language is one of the fundamental capacities of the human species, and there are many interesting and meaningful ways in which it can be studied.

Why do we continue to stage his plays, identify with his characters, and communicate our thoughts in his language? Why do his poems and plays retain their vibrancy and immediacy, even today?  This course invites students to answer these questions by inhabiting Shakespeare's language from the inside and out-breathing in the words of his characters with creative and careful study, while moving out to fully engage the text in performance. Reading plays, watching films, listening to monologues, voicing dialogue, physically enacting fight scenes, and even navigating plots with joysticks, students will develop deep appreciation for the writer who is the original GOAT-the greatest of all time. In this two-semester course, we will read and study Shakespeare's plays in their historical context, learning about the original practices used in performance at both the Elizabethan and Jacobean court theatres as well as the public theatres on the South Bank of the Thames.  We will also consider them as adaptable playscripts that have been rewritten over the past 400 years, reinterpreted at different times by different actors in different cultures the world over.  Students will contribute to this performance repertoire with their own 21st-century interpretations, striding the stage of the reconstructed Globe Theatre in a capstone experience that concludes the course with a summer trip to London.

How do the affordances of a digital tool amplify or suppress aspects of a source story? What new insights into familiar stories can we generate with radical adaptation? To engage these questions, this studio seminar blends humanistic scholarship with critical making, theatrical practice, and interdisciplinary, team-based agile development processes. Each two-week sprint engages a different immersive, theatricalized context, asking students to envision how the tools utilized therein might illuminate latent aspects of familiar stories. Topics include spatial computing/AR/VR/ XR, immersive theatre, theme parks, and cultural institutions/ museums. Additionally, this course utilizes critical making as an epistemology, wherein the site of knowledge creation is the process of devising an object, tool, performance, or installation in conversation with a discipline's critical apparatus. Accordingly, course-long projects will find students selecting and using immersive tools-digital, analog, or both-to radically adapt a familiar story, broadly construed.

In some cases, we can speak of metaphorical masks presented to the world; in others, the theater may use actual masks. We begin with classical antiquity, examining the differentiation of physical masks and characters in both tragedy and comedy (we will note that the word person comes from the Latin word persona, the word for mask in ancient Roman comedy). We then consider the complex system of types in classical Indian and later Kathakali dance-drama: types that each had specific emotions associated with them. Chinese musical theater of the fourteenth century, with strong ties to a rapidly growing urban environment, had its own distinct types. Following this unit we consider the masked characters of Italian Renaissance comedy (the commedia dell'arte) and its uncanny parallels to the nearby Karogöz, Turkish shadow puppet theater. We next move to the theater of Shakespeare, considering the boy actor and gender fluidity in Twelfth Night. Then we consider the realist playwright Ibsen, in view of the social roles performed by the play's characters. In Cloud Nine, Carol Churchill gives us insights into the performance of gender in modern life. A unit on modern and contemporary African drama examines the performance (or erasure) of political identity in crisis, as we read Athol Fugard's Sizwe Bansi is Dead and also the play Woza Albert! (Mtwa, Ngema, Simon). The course concludes with two African-American plays, August Wilson's Fences and Lynn Nottage's Sweat.

The course includes interactive discussions, group activities, and reading assignments. Activities not completed in class will be assigned as homework. The course involves activities specifically focused on numerical literacy, where students work with datasets, analyze trends, and create visual representations. These activities ensure that students not only engage with the narratives of historical figures but also develop practical skills in applied numeracy to explore and present data-driven insights. The final project involves creating and presenting a poster on a physicist not covered in the course. This project serves at challenging students to conduct independent research, analyze the numerical or scientific context of the physicist's contributions, and connect their work to broader societal or historical themes.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-60448","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Physics","title":"Introduction to Astrophysics I: From Stars to Black Holes","catalogNumber":"PHYSICS 2330","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355859","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Yuan, Yajie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,30]}]},"description":"First course of a two-semester calculus-based introduction to astronomy and astrophysics.

Subsequently, we study how dictators can counter these threats, looking at institutions (power-sharing institutions such as legislatures and information-related institutions such as elections), repression, cooptation, and information manipulation (propaganda and censorship).

It is also both shaped by, and helps constitute the meaning of, gender. This course asks the following questions: How has work been theorized in the history of political thought, and how ought we conceptualize work today? How does the gendering of work naturalize certain forms of labor, such as domestic work, mothering, and gestation? How might individuals resist these processes, thus remaking the meaning of work? And finally, what do we want the future of work to be? This course is divided into four parts, which track these four questions. First, we will read canonical works in political theory that frame the debate on work. Then, in part two we will move beyond gender-free conceptions of work, looking at kinds of work that have been quintessentially defined as “women’s work,” including domestic work, sex work, and gestational labor. Third, we will turn to the politics of resistance and the refusal of work, focusing on feminist refusals. Here, we look at social movements and moments in feminist history that challenge the naturalization of gendered labor, including the Wages for Housework movement and the Women’s Strike.

What are the implications of China's growing influence for the rest of the world? How did a once relatively poor nation transform into one of prosperity and stability? And will China's political system maintain its resilience over time? This course seeks to explore these questions, offering a comprehensive introduction to Chinese politics. Key topics include elite politics, censorship, protest, technology, trade, the military, diplomacy, and foreign policy.To better understand China's economic and political ascent, we will begin with a chronological exploration of its history, from the Imperial era to the present day. We will then investigate the resilience of China's authori­ tarian system and the factors behind its stability. Finally, we will assess the global impact of China's rise.

We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what religion might be and how it might be studied today.  No prior knowledge or experience of religion, religions, or anything religious is expected or required. This course is required for Religious Studies majors and minors.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_REST_3801","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Religious Studies","title":"Topics in Religious Studies:","catalogNumber":"REST 3720","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359605","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Kravchenko, Elena V."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"Topics vary by semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_SPAN_572","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Romance Languages and Literatures","title":"(Re)imagining the Greater Caribbean Through the Lens of Gender and Ethnicity","catalogNumber":"SPAN 5720","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-364328","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Sklodowska, Elzbieta"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"Conceived as a multicultural space, The Caribbean immediately calls to mind many complex images: the slave trade and plantation economy; the diaspora and Pan-Africanism; magical realism and the dark (post)colonial side of modernity. As Caribbeanists, we will look comparatively at the commonalities and the differences among the literary and cultural productions of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Columbia and Haiti, along with their respective diasporas. Exploring the notions of gender and ethnicity will enable us to further focus on such overarching themes as creolization and national building (belonging, inclusion, marginalization), gendered and racial politics of the diaspora, the performance of gender, sexual politics of tourism, the configuration of Afro-Latinidad, and the hybrid aesthetics emerging from the spiritual practices of African-derived (syncretic) religions. A combination of canonical and newest works will be presented in a variety of genres (testimonio, short stories, poetry, novels, theatre, film, essays, visual culture). In addition, we will tackle the complex methodological issues involved in cross-cultural and cross-racial research, including the works of Trouillot, Glissant, Césaire, Fanon, Mintz, La Fountain Stokes, Araújo, Benítez Rojo, Fernández Retamar, Torres Saillant, Paravisini-Gebert, among others.

Module 2 focuses on semantics and pragmatics, complemented by an exploration of variation in vocabulary throughout the Spanish-speaking world, such as how the English word popcorn may translate as palomitas, canguil, cancha, pochoclo, among various other options, depending on the Spanish-speaking region in question.

In this course we will test this assertion  by critically exploring one of the most intense and complex of human emotions: love. We will look at multidimensional and contradictory facets of love-from passion, desire, and happiness to solitude, betrayal and revenge, from family blood ties to bonds of community and patriotism, from motherhood to miscegenation-as they are  reimagined in a wide range of 20th and 21st century literary works, performances, films, artwork, music, and popular culture from across Latin American and Latinx diasporic communities. Love as affect and existential experience invariably intersects and becomes interwoven with such important dimensions of the socio-historical framework as ethnicity, class, gender, sexual identity, nationality, exile, and spirituality. In addition to poems, essays and short narratives by authors representing several Latin American countries and their diasporas (Neruda, Mistral, Quiroga, Storni, Benedetti, Garro, Castellanos, Fuentes, Morejón, Poniatowska, Ocampo, Borges, Cortázar, Bobes, Bahr, Vega Serova, Paz Soldán,  Obejas,  and Meruane, among others), we will examine academic research on the subject of love, blending insights from psychology, sociology, history, anthropology, religion studies, neuroscience, and philosophy. This focus on interdisciplinary approaches will encourage students to seek their own insights grounded in their experiences and areas  of expertise and to perceive love as a complex human condition that encompasses a plurality of socio-cultural expressions and unique individual relationships.

The course's focus is on the methods and applications rather than the theory and is intended for a broad audience. We will first explore predictive algorithms which perform classification and regression based on training datasets, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, boosting, naive Bayes classifiers, Gaussian process regression, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. As much as time allows it, we will then review clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques used to identify patterns in large-scale biological datasets, such as hierarchical clustering, mixture models and principal component analysis.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_SDS_5480","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Statistics and Data Science","title":"Topics in Statistics","catalogNumber":"SDS 5480","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-360566","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Kuffner, Todd Alan"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,80]}]},"description":"Topic varies with each offering.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_SDS_4971","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Statistics and Data Science","title":"Topics in Statistics: Data Mining","catalogNumber":"SDS 4971","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-358544","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Madrid padilla, Carlos misael"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[0,30]}]},"description":"Data mining is the process of uncovering meaningful patterns and making predictions from data, often in large and complex datasets.

But in the past few decades, scholars and activists have begun to challenge the notion that disability is a tragedy to be medically prevented or inspirationally overcome. These scholars have instead focused their attention on the social aspects of disability: how it came to be constructed as a category of identity, the physical and institutional barriers that have excluded disabled people from public life, and the distortion of disabled lives within the mainstream representation. More recently, writers have turned their attention to the way disability has been defined though norms of race, gender, and sexuality. These intersections will be the focus of this course. From the diagnoses of hysteria to debates over selective abortion and the recent proliferation of breast cancer memoirs, we will consider how the politics of disability has both complemented and complicated the usual goals of feminism. We will also explore some of the ways that disability studies as a discipline has redefined and in turn been shaped by the fields of queer theory, masculinity studies, and critical race theory. We will consider how deviant genders have been the target of medicalization, the relationship between corrective surgery and compulsory gendering, the desexualization and hypersexualization of disabled bodies, and the role that medicine has played in justifying colonial conquest and perpetuating racial inequalities.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_3942","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Community-Engaged Learning: Projects in Domestic Violence","catalogNumber":"WGSS 3690","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356325","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Ake, Jami L"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,13]}]},"description":"In this course, students explore the links between the theories and practices of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies through a combination of research and direct community engagement.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

That story is relentlessly optimistic, and simultaneously, devoid of an understanding of gender, sexual difference or race. In this course, we take a different approach. We discard the more conventional metrics of globalization by focusing instead on another equally global story: the manner by which human beings have been gendered and racialized over time. Doing so allows us to revisit globalization through its own deceptions, its interconnected secrets. We confront a different set of questions: how has intimacy shaped global mobility, what is the relationship between caste and MAMAA, between custom and the movement of capital, between slums and scale, between outsourcing and incarceration, how does the normative family propel global racial regimes? Most crucially, how and why is the emotional and intimate story of globalization concealed? The seminar class utilizes a wide array of sources, historical documents, scholarly critiques, novels and film and largely considers the longer, global history of India as the case study. Our specific focus will be on the secretive interconnections of slavery, seclusion, settlers, servitude, surrogacy, and scholarship, as we take a deep dive into the disguises, and the more hidden aspects, of globalization.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-61845","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Strangers at the Gate: Race, Sex, and Immigration in America","catalogNumber":"WGSS 3006","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-361791","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Esparza, Rene"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,21]}]},"description":"This course examines the history of U.S. immigration through the intertwined lenses of race, gender, and sexuality. From the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the Muslim Ban of the 21st century, U.S. immigration law has repeatedly codified who may enter, remain, and belong—and who is cast as perpetually foreign, “deviant,” or threatening. While the United States often celebrates itself as a “nation of immigrants,” its policies reveal deep contradictions in how citizenship and national identity are constructed. This course foregrounds the ways immigrants have been racialized, pathologized, and sexualized through law, medicine, and culture, paying particular attention to how notions of morality, disease, reproduction, and queerness shaped exclusion and belonging. We will also consider the strategies migrants and their communities have used to resist exclusion, forge alternative forms of belonging, and expanddefinitions of citizenship. By situating contemporary debates on immigration, asylum, and detention within a longer history of racial and sexual governance, this course interrogates the ongoing struggles over who counts as “American,” and how the line between stranger and citizen is continually redrawn.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_498","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Supervised Reading and Research","catalogNumber":"WGSS 4980","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356563","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is designed for students who are pursuing an independent study project as part of the Department Honors Program.

The course also examines the politics of space, how spaces are contested and deconstructed, and who is included or excluded within these spaces. We will learn from anti-colonial feminists about state processes of removing people from the land and historical and contemporary examples that fuel the legacy of gentrification, criminalization and land speculation.

One is to teach students -- via lectures, reading assignments, homework and exams, to think on their own, to solve problems and know how engineering principles are applied to the areas of bioelectricity, biomechanics, biomolecules, biotechnology and bioimaging. The second is to introduce students -- via guest lectures by school of medicine and engineering faculty, to some of the fascinating and challenging ongoing research in these areas. The course is challenging because students at this early stage, by and large, lack the knowledge base to understand either the engineering / biological aspects of the topical areas or the research being presented. Nevertheless, because future success depends on such, emphasis throughout is placed on developing self-learning as well as quantitative and analytical problem-solving skills, but at an appropriate level.

The course explores New York City's ambivalent relationship with America, with the world, and with itself. It focuses on matters of power - how, in different moments of the city's history, it was defined, who held it, and how various groups managed to contest for it; matters of exchange and extraction - political, cultural, and economic; and matters of belonging - whether a city of immigrants, exiles and refugees succeeded in becoming a home for the homeless. It pays close attention to both the micro - the street corner and the political ward; the bridge and the tunnel; the gentrifying neighborhood; the mosaic of the city's foodways; the theater, financial, slaughterhouse, brothel, and other districts - and the macro - the banks and the stock exchange; the port and transit authorities; the instrumentalities of knowledge and cultural production in the city's universities, print media, clubs, and salons; the sports empires; and the political machines, organized crime, grassroots labor and political movements, insurgencies, and undergrounds. Above all, the course will foreground the city's massive and unbearable contradictions, as a city of skyscrapers and of basement dives, lures, and snares; as a symbol of the future and freedom bound to traumatic, slave, and unfree pasts; as a symbol of modern independence bound to modern interdependence; and as a place of renaissances and ruinations, where the world either comes together or spectacularly falls apart.

This course will take up this problem as a way of beginning to think through what interventions femme might make into our ordinary ways of understanding gender and sexuality.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CHEM_495","school":"Olin Business School","department":"Chemistry","title":"Advanced Undergraduate Research in Chemistry","catalogNumber":"CHEM 4950","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356577","number":"02","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Berkland, Cory"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356576","number":"03","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Birman, Vladimir B"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356669","number":"05","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Gross, Michael L"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356667","number":"06","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Hayes, Sophia E."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356659","number":"07","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Heemstra, Jen"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356658","number":"08","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Hutchison, Brandon"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,10]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356657","number":"09","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Jackrel, Meredith E"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356647","number":"10","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Ke, Chenfeng"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356643","number":"11","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Loomis, Richard A."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356642","number":"12","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Mabbs, Richard"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356616","number":"13","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Moeller, Kevin D."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356613","number":"14","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Okuno, Yusuke"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356358","number":"15","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Patti, Gary J"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356347","number":"16","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Ponder, Jay William"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356345","number":"17","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Powderly, Kelly"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356344","number":"18","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Reichhardt, Courtney R"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356328","number":"19","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Sadtler, Bryce"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356327","number":"20","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Sobotka, Lee G."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356324","number":"21","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Taylor, John-Stephen A."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356314","number":"23","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Wencewicz, Timothy A"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356311","number":"24","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Wexler, Robert Bruce"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356309","number":"25","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Yu, Yan"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-356285","number":"26","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Zheng, Zach"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]}]},"description":"Registration for this course allows for advanced research mentored by a Department of Chemistry faculty member.

However, current rhetoric has brought this notion into question. This country has consistently been a magnet for millions of people from all over the world, and this course seeks broadly to understand recent African immigration. In Black studies, most attention has been paid to the forced migration of the enslaved during the Atlantic Slave trade. Studying 20th and 21st African immigration is key to truly understanding the Black experience in America. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.1 million Africans live in America as of 2015. The majority of these migrants are from Sub-Saharan Anglophone Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa), but they are also from war-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The primary focus of this course will be on contemporary African labor immigrants, including skilled professionals, children who arrived in the United States for family reunification, refugees, and winners of the Diversity Visa lottery who are now permanent residents. The migratory flux also includes people who were forced to leave their birth countries for political reasons as well as genocide. Through the class, we will examine the push and pull factors of immigration. The second part of the course explores the lived experience of Africans in America, whether they are well educated as compared with other migrant communities or whether they are laborers. We will study the role of remittances, language barriers, paths to naturalization, and job opportunities once Africans reach American soil. Increasingly, repatriation (both voluntarily and forced), xenophobia and Islamophobia are challenges that rock African immigrant communities. Today, many Africans live between two countries: Africa and America. This transnationalism allows them to navigate different lives, stories, identities, and cultures. Several activities are organized in the African local community. There is a large group of Ghanaians, Kenyans, Egyptians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Ethiopians, and Somalians in St. Louis. We will invite these individuals to the class as guest speakers so that students can fully understand their multiple lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_209B","school":"Olin Business School","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"African Studies: Mapping Urban Languages and Resistance in Africa","catalogNumber":"AFAS 2090","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-363768","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Mutonya, Mungai"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,30]}]},"description":"This course will introduce students to a variety of approaches to the study of Africa by considering the ways that scholars have understood the African experience.

How can research translate into opportunities beyond the classroom, from service to politics? In this workshop AMCS Majors explore these questions while receiving support at a crucial milestone, the Senior Capstone. Through reflection and writing students develop a stronger intellectual identity, and consider how their research prepares them to participate in conversations and activities that transcend scholarship. This participation is a kind of academic citizenship with students leveraging their learning to engage intellectual, social, and political life in and beyond campus. Students do this primarily through consideration of their capstone research, happening concurrently in the AMCS Capstone Workshop or in an approved seminar. While encouraging Majors to consider the intersection of their academic and personal goals, the workshop supports research (e.g., guest faculty discuss methodology), gives structure to activities already required for the Major (e.g., the capstone abstract), and builds community (e.g., peer-led discussions). The workshop also provides time and space for students to curate their AMCS portfolio.

Today, one billion people live in informal cities (36% of the world's population) and this is expected to grow another one billion over the next 30 years.  As it is currently evolving, the informal city is an urban phenomenon set up within the planned city's territory and increasingly an integral part of it--often comprising up to 75% of the city and one of the elements of urban morphology that shapes city design.  Thus, it is no longer possible to accept a concept of the informal city that centered on negative parameters (ghettos/slums/poverty/crime, etc.), but there is a need to find sustainable spatial solutions to integrate these settlements into the formal urban/architectural tissue leading to the dissolution of urban and symbolic boundaries between the informal areas and formal districts.  To this end, the course will review various architecture and urban strategies and projects of informal urbanism in Asia, Africa and South America supported with a field trip will help to further understand and define a place of action for architects and urbanists in the informal city.

Noguchi created dozens of plaster models of lunar landscapes; however, only three were built: a ceiling in the Time and Life Building in New York, the interior wall of the SS Argentina Ocean Liner, and the American Stove Company ceiling in St. Louis. The American Stove ceiling, though only recently uncovered in 2016, is the only lunar landscape still in existence today. The earlier models, often misunderstood as sculptures, were proposals for spaces meant to be inhabited. Noguchi identified himself primarily as a sculptor and had no architectural training; however, he commanded an extraordinary understanding of space. He designed spaces at various scales, from the body to urban design proposals to outer space, as well as a range of functions – furniture, theater sets, memorials, and monuments. The course will revisit his work, and, through models and photography, reimagine them as inhabitable spaces. Students will individually analyze selected models of Noguchi's realized and unbuilt work in tandem with a discussion of texts by Noguchi and others that explore his life and career. Coursework will include experimental visualization techniques, archival research and writing, physical model building, and photography. The class will include a visit to the U-Haul facility (formerly the American Stove Headquarters) to view Noguchi’s ceiling, as well as the Wash U archives and SLAM to review archival models and drawings of the space.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MUD_525K","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Land Arch Urb: Landscapearchitectureurbanism","catalogNumber":"URBDES 5411","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-357439","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Daskalakis, Georgia L."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[780,950],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"New Disciplinary Dynamics: Blurs and Exchanges. Over the past decade, the various professions engaged in the construction of the built environment have been investigating (both in theory and practice) a specific and deliberate blurring, hybridization, and expansion of the traditional semantic and historical categories of landscape, architecture, and urbanism in an attempt to confront changing situations, environments, and cultures. Across geographical and cultural boundaries, the proliferation of projects (speculative and built) and essays appearing in recent years makes this phenomenon more than a passing trend or the product of individual reflection. Architecture, for example, as a conventional discipline with its own tasks, internal logic, and modus operandi has become so heterogeneous that it can no longer adequately authenticate its products from within the limits of its historical category. The same holds true of the allied fields of landscape and urbanism. Strict disciplinary boundaries are no longer capable of attending to the complexity of contemporary demands produced by mobility, density, de-urbanization, hybrid programs, changing uses, and ecological concerns. The contemporary world forcibly imposes the need for greater flexibility and indeterminacy and for new techniques of practice that are anticipatory, receptive to change, and capable of opening an aperture to the future. This course will explore these disciplinary slippages and hybrid contacts between until now distinct categories through essays and built or speculative works.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_LAND_401","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Landscape Architecture Design Studio I","catalogNumber":"LANDARCH 5110","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359511","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Bonvehi Rosich, Montserrat"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"This core studio explores design principles common to architecture and landscape architecture as well as their own specificity. a series of problems will focus onthe relation of component to space through conceptual, analytical, formal, and perceptual investigations.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_LAND_501","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Landscape Architecture Design Studio III","catalogNumber":"LANDARCH 6110","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359501","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"This studio investigates the planning and design of a post-industrial site in Saint Louis city, through reclamation strategies and an understanding of the site's ecological, historical, and cultural underpinnings.

Throughout human history, and particularly in the modern period, interior space and its experience has served as both the beginning, the initial inspiration for the design of architecture, as well as the end, the final purpose of architecture as it is evaluated through inhabitation. Since the beginning of the modern period, and continuing today, pivotal discoveries in architectural design may be traced back to a generative ideal of intimate interior experience, and the quality of the interior spatial experience of the inhabitants may be shown to be both the primary determinant of the architectural design process, as well as the means of appropriately evaluating a work of architecture after it is built. This seminar explores how interior space has been integral to the development of modern architecture, and how generations of modern architects have engaged interior space and its experience in their design processes, enabling them to fundamentally transform the traditional methods and goals of architectural composition. For the leading modern architects and for the most recognized and respected architects practicing today, the conception of the interior spatial experience continues to be the necessary starting point for design, and the inhabitation of interior space remains the primary reason to construct works of architecture.   Each class will consist of both faculty lectures based on the chapters of the textbook, The Space Within, and, parallel with the textbook themes, student analyses of selected interior spaces in Florence and Venice, to be visited during the first half of the fall semester. Analytical methods employed in the course cover the full range of contextual, cultural, material, constructive, and experiential attributes of buildings, with particular emphasis on the manner in which the spaces of a building are ordered by the patterns of occupation and the poetics of use, as well as the poetics of construction, or the way in which a building is built, and of what materials it is made, and how all these combine to construct the experience of those who inhabit it.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_601","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Theories & Methods of Historical Research","catalogNumber":"ARCH 6901","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-360829","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Mumford, Eric Paul"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[780,950],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"What is architectural history?

The seminar will act as a laboratory where a common theme is examined from multiple perspectives.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_403B","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Urban Mining in Architectural Design","catalogNumber":"ARCH 4519","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-365474","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Yin, Hongxi"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[1080,1160],"seats":[0,14]}]},"description":"Urban Mining, encompassing deconstruction, salvage, and reuse, aims to recover materials and components from existing old buildings to repurpose them in new construction, which can significantly reduce embodied energy and carbon footprints while creating new forms. Design for Urban Mining (DfUM) presents a new paradigm for architectural design for sustainability. In Spring 2025, team WashU will investigate DfUM concepts, methods, and processes by experimenting with (1) design with salvaged material for future construction, (2) design with the concept of future deconstruction, (3) showcasing urban mining innovations through an experimental living unit, potentially contribute to, Chicago Architecture Biennial (CAB 2025). Students will use design/build as a vehicle to study how architectural design deals with resources from the city and how it can create attractive architectural forms. The course will include literature review of the state of the arts, and the research may be transformed into a formal journal or conference publication.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_LAND_521A","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Visualizing Ecological Processes","catalogNumber":"LANDARCH 6111","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-359497","number":"01","term":"2026 Fall","instructor":["Suliman Hamid, Alaa"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[510,680],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"This course focuses on building skills in 3D modeling, animation and simulation to add 4D (time) processes into analysis, experimentation and presentation.
