However, current rhetoric has brought this notion into question. This country has consistently been a magnet for millions of people from all over the world, and this course seeks broadly to understand recent African immigration. In Black studies, most attention has been paid to the forced migration of the enslaved during the Atlantic Slave trade. Studying 20th and 21st African immigration is key to truly understanding the Black experience in America. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2.1 million Africans live in America as of 2015. The majority of these migrants are from Sub-Saharan Anglophone Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa), but they are also from war-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Somalia. The primary focus of this course will be on contemporary African labor immigrants, including skilled professionals, children who arrived in the United States for family reunification, refugees, and winners of the Diversity Visa lottery who are now permanent residents. The migratory flux also includes people who were forced to leave their birth countries for political reasons as well as genocide. Through the class, we will examine the push and pull factors of immigration. The second part of the course explores the lived experience of Africans in America, whether they are well educated as compared with other migrant communities or whether they are laborers. We will study the role of remittances, language barriers, paths to naturalization, and job opportunities once Africans reach American soil. Increasingly, repatriation (both voluntarily and forced), xenophobia and Islamophobia are challenges that rock African immigrant communities. Today, many Africans live between two countries: Africa and America. This transnationalism allows them to navigate different lives, stories, identities, and cultures. Several activities are organized in the African local community. There is a large group of Ghanaians, Kenyans, Egyptians, Senegalese, Nigerians, Ethiopians, and Somalians in St. Louis. We will invite these individuals to the class as guest speakers so that students can fully understand their multiple lives in the St. Louis metropolitan area.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_209B","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"African Studies: Mapping Urban Languages and Resistance in Africa","catalogNumber":"AFAS 2090","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-341625","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Mutonya, Mungai"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[11,23]}]},"description":"This course will introduce students to a variety of approaches to the study of Africa by considering the ways that scholars have understood the African experience.

After strong-arming a place at the center of American popular culture, hip-hop quickly found an international resonance that allowed it to be adapted and (re)mixed around the world. This course offers a cultural history of hip-hop music in America. It begins in hip-hop's earliest days, when a small number of local DJs borrowed from transnational music technologies to provide the soundscape for park jams in the South Bronx. It then traces the subsequent emergence of graffiti artists, breakers and b-boys, and the eventual rise of the MC as the central iconic figure of the music. Taking students on a trip through music, the course will scrutinize lyrics, interrogate the art of beat-making, and highlight important cultural turns in history. We will examine the contours of key representative careers, canonical albums, and pivotal debates, and we will unpack the histories of key institutions, including important nightclubs, sound studios, record labels, and radio stations. In addition, we will also discuss hip-hop's influence on fashion, sports and other sectors of the global economy. Over the course of the semester, students will engage with a wide array of traditional and multimedia sources, including articles, books, interviews, magazines, music (individual songs and full albums), films, music videos, lyrics, and photography. By the end of the course, students will walk away with a working knowledge of the shifting sound, vocabulary and aesthetics of hip-hop music as it has developed across America.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_103D","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"Beginning Swahili I","catalogNumber":"AFAS 1610","units":5,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_AFAS_103D_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Mutonya, Mungai"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[13,15]}]},"description":"A beginning language course emphasizing acquisition of reading, writing, and conversational skills in Swahili language.

The course combines grounding in reckonings with historic injustice in the context of greater St. Louis with comparative engagement with other U.S. and global contexts. Engaging these issues from a variety of perspectives — spanning the humanities and social sciences, art and design, public health, law, and education — we will apply theoretical and empirical frameworks to existing or potential approaches to transformative transitional justice. Our core aim is to work together to consider and build comparative and collective understanding of community reckonings with the legacies of historic injustice, informing local, national and global reparative efforts.

As many as 3,000 languages are spoken across Africa's 54 countries, each defined by a unique blend of urban and rural cultures. The people of the Central African country of Chad belong to more than 100 ethnic groups. From their regional affiliations to their sociocultural perspectives, Africa's writers are no less diverse, its literary traditions no less dynamic. By examining texts from various genres and regions, we will trace the development of African literature by considering its roots in the oral traditions and colonial history of the continent, its role in the articulation of African subjectivity on the road to independence, its response to the challenges of the post-independence era, and its present-day stronghold within the global literary marketplace.

How can history-based games help people learn about the history of Black experience and how that past manifests in the present? What does experiential learning through games oer that traditional formats do not? The Black experience is underrepresented in game design history, but is gamifying Black history problematic? What do representation and embodiment mean in gamifying Black history, both in terms of the characters or events the game depicts as well as the racial identities of the people creating and playing the games? In what contexts might these intersections between history and the imagination build empathy, be triggering, or become voyeuristic? Do history-based games that combine historical people and settings with fictional components distort history, or enable players to engage with a non-linear, non-teleological past? Must historically-based games adhere to historical realism so as not to mislead, or can games which present alternatives to how the past played out become lessons in historical contingency, or be a form of resistance or satire which critique or challenge conceptions of the past or offers subversive or liberatory alternatives? Should games always be “fun,” or can they convey a serious message that fosters reflection and dialogue? Is it appropriate to create games about serious subjects? Can games appropriately hold seriousness and humor, joy, or playfulness in tension to communicate a larger message? This course teaches methods and theory of public history (ways in which non-historians encounter and engage with the past in their everyday lives) by exploring these questions through the examination of tabletop board games and card games, role-playing games, computer and video games, virtual reality, and choose-your-own adventure literature, analyzing how game medium, format, design, mechanics, and setting of play shape their appropriateness, efficacy, and reception. Students will explore the ethics and impact of representing African American history in games by playing games when appropriate, as well as through more distanced examination of Black history gamification through critical reviews of games and discussion of games and scholarly literature about gamifying Black history.

By 2050 this number is expected to triple to 1.23 billion or what will then be sixty percent of the continent's total population. This urban growth is happening alongside rapid economic expansion, technological innovations, and-in some cities-political insurrection. Many of these developments are taking place in peripheral urban areas that lack formal planning, basic infrastructure, and security.  Yet, as many theorists point out, the very lack of cohesive planning and stable infrastructure in urban Africa has produced flexible spaces where novel forms of dwelling, work, and leisure are possible. Many residents, often by necessity, rearrange their built environments to make the city function beyond the limits of its original design. In the process, urban dwellers produce new built spaces, aesthetics, and economic practices, calling into question assumptions about what a city is and how it works. What are the implications of Africa's urban revolution for both the people who inhabit these cities and the world at large? How will Africa's urban future shape what some theorists are calling the African century? What can contemporary cities across the continent tell us about the future of urban life everywhere? In this seminar, we will explore these questions by surveying a variety of case studies and topics from across the African continent. The purpose in focusing on Africa in general is not to homogenize an incredibly diverse continent, but to make connections across a variety of different contexts in order to explore conceptual debates and assemble a theoretical tool-kit that is useful for grappling with themes that are simultaneously abstract and concrete.

How can research translate into opportunities beyond the classroom, from service to politics?

This participation is a kind of academic citizenship with students leveraging their learning to engage intellectual, social, and political life in and beyond campus. Students do this primarily through consideration of their capstone research, happening concurrently in the AMCS Capstone Workshop or in an approved seminar. While encouraging Majors to consider the intersection of their academic and personal goals, the workshop supports research (e.g., guest faculty discuss methodology), gives structure to activities already required for the Major (e.g., the capstone abstract), and builds community (e.g., peer-led discussions).

However, for complex reasons, their presence has either been concealed, or dismissed through dangerous stereotypes, or just as inaccurately, excessively celebrated for proving the generosity of American liberalism and multiculturalism. Racially misrecognized, this large and heterogeneous group has nonetheless shaped American categories of race, sexuality, and citizenship in intriguing and powerful ways. South Asian Americans have reached to fiction, music and popular culture to craft deeply intimate and original assessments of mainstream desires. In doing so they have sought to resist the dictates of whiteness, to question US imperialism, to garner acceptance and mobility, to build solidarity with other US minorities. In this course we learn about the complex history and cultural productions of South Asians in America. How did South Asia become a category of identification, and who benefitted from that designation? What role have South Asians played in the economic, cultural and global ascendancy of the United States? How do South Asians connect with, and control, their countries of origin? Why do discourses of sex and intimacy rise to the surface in this history, and what is the significance of story-telling in building the archive and questioning the fiction of South Asian America? Course enrollment is limited to first-year and sophomore students.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_359H","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"HOT Takes: Cultural Criticism in the Digital Age","catalogNumber":"AMCS 3053","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338863","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Maciak, Phillip Jon"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[19,22]}]},"description":"The twenty-first century has seen a new and exciting wave of cultural criticism, and along with it a new wave of public intellectuals. Ta-Nehisi Coates, Roxane Gay, Jia Tolentino, Anne Helen Petersen, Jo Livingstone, Hanif Abdurraqib-at their best, writers like these aspire to the sort of indispensability on political, social, and artistic matters that their forebears like Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, and James Baldwin had at midcentury. But these voices are unique because they emerged through and alongside a specifically online critical sphere, a space betwixt and between the comments section and the little magazine. This is the space of viral tweets and threads, hot takes and think-pieces. It's a space of potentially greater democratization and diversity even as it is an opportunity for bigots and trolls. These writers are beholden to their networks, but those networks are far wider, more idiosyncratic and inclusive and incendiary-more unstable-than anything buttressing the vaunted public intellectuals of the past. This course examines the cultural critics of the contemporary moment in context of the critical space they opened and now occupy. We'll begin with a quick history of the public intellectual from the eighteenth century to the present before we log on. The rise and fall of Gawker, Grantland, and The Awl; The New Republic's controversial digital pivot; the feminist communities of The Hairpin and The Toast; the conservative intellectual dark web; the message boards of the early 2000s; the emergence of semi-academic sites like the Los Angeles Review of Books; the blogs and tumblrs and livejournals that nurtured the talents and provocateurs that we now find indispensable or unavoidable. We will dissect their style, understand their theory and practice, engage with their subjects, and investigate the way their writing has intersected with and propelled social media movements like Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, and #OscarsSoWhite. And we will consider the way these critics have influenced the way scholars and students approach the texts and topics we always have.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_229","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Introduction to AMCS: #americanculturestudies: Exploring the Field!","catalogNumber":"AMCS 2290","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_AMCS_229_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Walsh, David G."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[18,21]}]},"description":"What does it mean to do American culture studies? This course teaches students how to critically analyze U.S. culture and society and introduces them to the history, methodologies, frameworks, and key questions that have shaped and continue to inform this interdisciplinary field. American culture studies is a broad and vast discipline that defies simple summary; it asks probing questions to uplift marginalized voices and experiences as part of an expansive definition of American identity. This course exposes students to practices that constitute American culture studies rather than demarcate a terrain for what it is: historically crossing disciplinary boundaries (arts, humanities, social sciences) and engaging diverse texts (film, literature, historical documents, popular culture, performance, material culture, etc.) American culture studies resists strict definition!  In this course students study how knowledge and understandings about society and culture are produced and learn approaches to analyzing, curating and interpreting cultural objects and theorizing cultural phenomena. We examine the concept and idea of America in local, regional, national, and international contexts and continuums; we explore the lived experiences of diverse American communities within and across cultural and literal borders.  Through a case study approach, the course engages questions related to the construction of ethnic and racial identities in the U.S.; visual, material, and digital cultures; social thought and social issues; mass media and popular culture; gender and sexuality; citizenship and nationhood; art, literature, and performance; and American imperialism.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_352A","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"The Black Athlete in American Literature: Frederick Douglass to Lebron James","catalogNumber":"AMCS 3528","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-339755","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Cohan, Noah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[13,21]}]},"description":"The black athlete is a central figure in American entertainment, and has been since Frederick Douglass decried Christmastime slave games in his Narrative.

While diet fads come and go, it seems this new enthusiasm for Paleo diets is here to stay. But what is a Paleo diet anyway? Through a comparative evolutionary and anthropological approach we will examine the diets of extinct hominins, our extant primate relatives, ethnohistoric and contemporary foraging peoples, and even our own dietary habits. We will strive to answer key questions about diets in prehistory and their implications for living people today: How do we know what our ancestors ate? How have dietary hypotheses been used to explain processes in human evolution? How bad is agriculture for global health? What role did certain foods play in shaping our modern physiology? Are we maladapted to our contemporary diets? What does it mean to eat Paleo? A mix of discussion and lecture will encourage students to develop their own interests in human evolutionary nutrition.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-60197","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"First-Year Opportunity: Research and Conservation in Zoos and Botanical Gardens","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 1811","units":2,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-341514","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sanz, Crickette"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[20,20]}]},"description":"An introduction to the world of zoos and botanical gardens.

Understandings of the proper roles, sensibilities, emotions, and dispositions of women and men are often culturally and morally loaded as indicators of the proper selves permitted in a given context.  Across cultures, then, gender often becomes an expressive idiom for the relative health of the self.  Gender identities or presentations that run counter to these conventions are frequently identified as disordered and in need of fixing.  In this course, we will take up these issues through three fundamental themes:  the social and cultural (re)production of gendered bodies and dispositions; the normalization of these productions and the subsequent location of madness in divergent or dissonant experiences of embodiment; and the situation of discourses of madness within debates of resistance and conformity, selfhood and agency.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_3885","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Global Mental Health","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 3885","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ANTHRO_3885_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Canna, Maddalena"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[38,40]}]},"description":"What does global mental health mean for different actors and stakeholders?

Whether it's brushing your teeth, checking your e-mail, or taking the bus, you use infrastructures regularly. Yet people pay little attention to them-until they break down. From the inconvenience of your bus being late to the emergency of deadly power outages or floods, infrastructures are vital. This seminar is an anthropological study of infrastructure's role in governance, livelihood, sociality, & cultural meaning in urban life. By looking at different forms of and experiences with infrastructure around the world, we will discuss varying understandings of infrastructure, theorize what it does, and analyze its politics. We begin by drawing from anthropology, political theory, and science & technology studies to think about what studying infrastructure entails; thereafter, the course centers on anthropological engagements with infrastructure in the Global South to rethink what infrastructure is and does. Throughout, weekly writing exercises will hone observational, methodological, and writing skills while pushing students to think about infrastructure and daily life in new ways through experiences on campus and in St. Louis.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_3101","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Topics in Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 3101","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ANTHRO_3101_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Patania, Ilaria"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[27,30]}]},"description":"Discuss different topics in Anthropology","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_4104","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Topics in Anthropology:","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4104","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ANTHRO_4104_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Olson, Kyle Gregory"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[10,11]}]},"description":"A course covering topics in one of the three subdisciplines of anthropology","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_4107","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Topics in Archaeology: Archaeology of the Living World","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4107","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ANTHRO_4107_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Baitzel, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[4,15]}]},"description":"As anthropologists, archaeologists are familiar with the animate nature of reality as experienced by most people at most times in human history.

From the creation and use of masks, to the building and maintenance of grand palaces, to the construction of entire monumental landscapes, these groups explored and made sense of life, reality, and being within a wider cosmos, via inventive engagement across multiple material and intangible media, and through exploration of various aesthetic, spiritual, and social philosophies mediated by the production of art, architecture, and landscape. As people worked with clays, metals, stone, textiles, ivories, and other materials, they navigated social realities such as political hierarchy and gender divisions, connected with religious notions such as the continued role of ancestors and deities in daily life, and shaped, explored, and represented their very notions of being. Especially prevalent across many of the arts of these regions were evolving notions of motion, change, innovation, and assemblage that underpinned artistic and architectural engagement. Art, architecture, and landscape manifested and reified these concepts and philosophies in a number of ways, regularly designed to be used and conceived of in motion (e.g., masks and masquerade costumes), centering individual and group innovation and improvisation in their composition (e.g., in distinctive styles of figurative arts), and often combining and interacting with other parts to form larger assemblages or composites that were seen to act upon the world in new ways (e.g., shrines and sacred grove sites)","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARTARCH_5602","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Art History and Archaeology","title":"Italian Renaissance and Baroque Architecture","catalogNumber":"ARTARCH 5603","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-339814","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Gabel, Esther Elliott Brummer"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"This course will survey the development of architecture in Italy from 1400 to 1700.

Students will apply their newly learned computational skills and use their pipeline to analyze virus sequence evolution and explore evolutionary models.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_BIOL_2970","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Biology","title":"Principles of Biology II","catalogNumber":"BIOL

However, one needs specialized numerical methods and computational chemistry skills to explore these questions. This course is designed to bridge this gap. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical and computational skills necessary to model chemical phenomena at the atomic level. We start by building a strong foundation in mathematical representations of chemical problems, utilizing open-source software tools for problem-solving, data interpretation, and visualization of materials and molecular structures. In the second part of the course, we delve into the fascinating world of atomic-level computer modeling. You'll learn various methodologies, such as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics. We'll analyze static (thermodynamic and structural) and dynamic properties and their statistical errors. Don't worry if you're new to coding - we'll cover the basics of Python programming in the first few lectures, setting you up for success. By the end of this course, you will be proficient in using computational tools, understanding atomic interactions, and approaching chemical problems with a structured and strategic thought process.

Over the course of the semester, the students learn how macroscopic observations of stoichiometry, chemical reactions, the properties of elements and compounds, and chemical periodicity developed into the microscopic understanding of molecular structure and bonding. The semester begins with fundamentals related to stoichiometry, chemical reactions, solution chemistry, and gas properties, with an emphasis on quantitative problem solving. The octet rule, Lewis structures, and valence-shell-electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory are then introduced as early efforts to describe the stability and structures of molecules. The localized electron model (LEM) and molecular-orbital theory (MOT) are next described as modern descriptions of chemical bonding. The course concludes with intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This course will be a serious introductory series that requires and develops algebraic-computation and problem-solving skills.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CHEM_590","school":"Arts &

Storming the villa was just one example of a quest Germans had been undertaking since the Renaissance: to find German national identity with the help of Ancient Greece and Rome. Graeco-Roman antiquity provided the Germans with the first comprehensive description of their  ancient ancestors in the Germania and their first national hero, Arminius. In this course, we will study the impact of that Greece and Rome had on German national identity starting in the 16th century when a group of poet-scholars transformed the Germania and Arminius into central components of German national identity. We will trace it through the Enlightenment in the 17th-18th centuries and into the age of imperialism in the 19th century when the first monument to Arminius was erected in Germany, the so-called \"Hermannsdenkmal\" (Monument to Arminius). We will end with how the Nazis reinterpreted the culture of Ancient Greece and Rome as a justification for fascism and violent nationalism. We will debate extensively and write in detail about questions of authority, identity, tolerance, intolerance,  belonging, and ultimately why classical culture has been one of the most influential forces of the last 500 years. Our focus will lie on three key questions, each of incomparable relevance in today's world:  1. Why did German nationalists turn to Ancient Greece and Rome? Addressing this question willhelp us understand the decisive role classical antiquity has had since Rome fell in 476 CE  2. What specific mechanisms were used to interpret Graeco-Roman culture and knowledge? Answering this will allow us to evaluate how history is always in service of identity and power.  3. How did German identity develop? Evaluating this will help us understand how Renaissance-era poet-scholars were at the beginning of an identity creation that exploded in the 1900s.  Our goals are to understand classical culture's potential for use and abuse, and to develop tools for historical thought and insight that help us understand the past and present.  Writing Intensive Course","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-60038","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Classics","title":"Gender, Class, and Comedy: Ancient and Modern","catalogNumber":"CLASSICS 3540","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-339908","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Moore, Timothy Joseph"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":null}]},"description":"Few cultural products are effective as dramatic comedy in revealing, reflecting, critiquing how societies respond to differences of gender and social class.

There is much \"under the hood\" of the vehicle of epic language that is often left to the specialists to fuss over: an odd form here or a hidden digamma there. This course seeks to dispel some of the perceived dread of \"old-school philology\" that often haunts discussions of epic grammar, while serving as a practical guide to the utility of such apparently quibbling pursuits as hunting for hidden digammas.We will consider the origins of the epic \"dialect,\" including questions of historical grammar, and its relation to other dialects of ancient Greek. We will investigate poetic grammar from the micro to the macro level: From minutia of metrics, poetic formulas, and particle use to larger structural units like ring composition and poetic repair.We will be most concerned with the interfaces of structure and meaning: Are particularly spondee-heavy lines associated with a particular tone or gravity of sense? Does the lack of augment convey some special signification? These and other questions will be addressed in depth, spearheaded by the students' own interrogation into topics of most interest to themselves.Students will produce a final paper that allows them to engage with these topics in conversation with current research in the field of Homeric studies. In doing so, we will see how heavily linguistic analysis bears on textual interpretation and how careful attention to Homer's use of language can bring us to a deeper appreciation of his work and its motives.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_LATIN_497","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Classics","title":"Honors Course I","catalogNumber":"LATIN 4970","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_LATIN_497_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_LATIN_497_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"Students interested in pursuing honors should consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Classics.

Casting spells, fashioning voodoo dolls, wearing amulets, ingesting potions, and reading the stars are just some of the activities performed by individuals at every level of society. This course examines Greco-Roman, early Christian, and Judaic magical practices. Students read spell-books which teach how to read the stars, make people fall in love, bring harm to enemies, lock up success in business, and win fame and the respect of peers. Students also look at what is said, both in antiquity and in contemporary scholarship, about magic and the people who practiced it, which helps illuminate the fascinating relationship between magic, medicine, and religion.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CLASSICS_251","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Classics","title":"Projecting the Past: Ancient Greece and Rome in Modern Film","catalogNumber":"CLASSICS 2510","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_CLASSICS_251_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sears, Rebecca Ann"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[45,60]}]},"description":"Since the earliest days of film, screenwriters and directors have mined the rich history of Ancient Greece and Rome to captivate audiences with tales of heroes and slaves, soldiers and lovers.

These decisions affect our environment, public health, state infrastructure, and government at every level. Identifying trustworthy academic research and journalism while resisting misguided public opinion and malicious disinformation campaigns can be daunting, particularly when we reflect on our own vulnerability to cognitive biases. Citizen Scientist aims to develop the ability to distinguish meaningful expertise from self-interested distortions and status quo platitudes. Inspired by our shared civic responsibility, Citizen Scientist teaches students to analyze and generate evidenced-based arguments that engage opinion, policy, activism, journalism, personal experience, and the research university. THIS COURSE SATISFIES THE FIRST-YEAR WRITING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DIVISIONS.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CWP_113","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Writing Program","title":"College Writing: Dreams & Nightmares","catalogNumber":"CWP 1503","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_19_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sherratt, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_02_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Koehn, Emily Katherine"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[720,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_06_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Gregory, Meg"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[11,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_07_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sanders, Michael J"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_08_S","number":"06","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Slachman, Virginia"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[7,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_09_S","number":"07","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waitman, Grace"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_10_S","number":"08","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Adams, Rachel"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_11_S","number":"09","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Slachman, Virginia"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_14_S","number":"10","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sanders, Michael J"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_13_S","number":"11","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Adams, Rachel"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_15_S","number":"12","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waitman, Grace"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_16_S","number":"13","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Adams, Rachel"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_17_S","number":"14","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Sanders, Michael J"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[11,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_113_18_S","number":"15","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waitman, Grace"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-347826","number":"16","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waitman, Grace"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[12,12]}]},"description":"This course is an opportunity to explore and experiment, to dwell in uncertainty and inquiry, and to entertain confusion before resolution.

How might your taste in potato chips relate to your choice in winter coat? How does writing itself contribute to larger cultural conversations? This course will explore how our choices as consumers, creators, and writers are mediated by broader cultural forces such as foodways, fashion, music, advertisement, art, and social media. \"Commodity culture\" refers to what aspects of culture can be evaluated in terms of supposed \"worth\" or economic value. Here students will think critically, draft, take risks, and revise to present work that has been elevated to college-level writing and argumentation. Readings will explore a range of rigorous scholarship and multimedia texts -- whether it's the importance of cultural capital in college admissions, the role of social media in the rise of self-branding, recognizing accessibility in our known environment, Taylor Swift’s connection to “rainbow capitalism,” or the blurred line between high art and  Instagram. As avid readers and writers, we will delve into the details of rhetorical context to approach both published media and our own essays as instances of cultural production. No prior knowledge of foodways, art history, or media studies is necessary for this course, but students are expected to develop a nuanced appreciation of how something as seemingly innocuous as cultural output intersects with larger structures of status, power, and social justice. THIS COURSE SATISFIES THE FIRST-YEAR WRITING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DIVISIONS.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CWP_118","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Writing Program","title":"College Writing: Technology & Selfhood","catalogNumber":"CWP 1508","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_02_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[720,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_03_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[780,830],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_04_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[840,890],"seats":[10,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_06_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_08_S","number":"06","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[11,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_10_S","number":"07","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Henderson, Rin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_11_S","number":"08","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-339844","number":"09","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waters, Aileen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202505_CWP_118_12_S","number":"10","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waters, Aileen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-350592","number":"11","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Waters, Aileen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]}]},"description":"Writing is a technology that allows one to read the thoughts of others across space and time. Our course's theme -- technology -- is the subject matter that we will be reading to hone skills such as analysis, argumentation, and critical thinking. This does not mean that a student must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform a student into one. Rather, this course treats technology in its broadest sense, from its root in the Greek techne (which means craftsmanship, craft, art, or rhetoric) to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology, we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays, we will address responsible uses of technology and the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and we will try to answer questions like the following: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? What roles do we want it to play in our future?

Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest. The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course. The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing. For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work. The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals). Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims. The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions. Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments. The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods. The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods. Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess scholarly research and public discourses on education, as well as their own experiences.

In this course, we will examine the history of the picture book, from the earliest illustrated educational texts to John Newbery's groundbreaking delights to the socially conscious picture books of the 21st century. We will use the picture book to trace important social and educational movements given its use as a tool to impart cultural values and knowledge. We will also examine important moments in picture book publishing history, most notably, the post-war Little Golden Books phenomenon. Authors and illustrators of study will include Randolph Caldecott, Beatrix Potter, Maurice Sendak, Ezra Jack Keats, Bruno Munari, Jerry Pinkney, Eric Carle, Tana Hoban, Leo and Diane Dillon, and Christian Robinson. Students will engage critically with both text and image, delving into the way images communicate meaning. The course will also contemplate important contemporary issues, most notably, race and representation in picture books and the rise of picture book bans. This course is well-suited for students interested in illustration, education, publishing, and cultural studies, and is appropriate for students pursuing the children's studies minor.

In this course, we will examine, from a writerly perspective, the nature of that divide. Is it merited? Are science fiction and fantasy stories so fundamentally different in their construction from their conventional counterparts as to require a radically different approach, and if so, what unique devices do writers of imaginative fiction employ to set their stories apart? Our guide in this exploration will be Jeff Vandermeer's Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction, which we will be considering not just as an instruction manual, but as a representative text. How does Wonderbook -- in its content, construction, and conceit -- differ from more standard writing reference books? How is it similar? In what ways does Vandermeer's guide embody its subject matter? To aid us in this examination, we will be considering contemporary science fiction and fantasy stories by writers on both sides of the genre fence. The purpose of our reading is generative as well as illustrative. We seek to employ what we learn. There will be multiple writing exercises building towards a ten-to-twenty-page science fiction or fantasy story. As a final project, students will submit their collected writings as part of their own Wonderbook.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_300","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3999","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_300_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Arch, Jennifer"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,2]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_300_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_300_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is for independent study in English Literature.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_400","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 4999","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_400_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_400_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_400_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is for independent study in English Literature.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 5999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Brown, J Dillon"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Schmidgen, Wolfram M"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_500_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"Prerequisite: junior or senior standing.

In this class, we will focus on explicitly political writing by writers who are not politicians, that is to say, sanctioned experts in the affairs of the polis. Foregoing public policy memoranda and economic analyses, we will look at how journalists, grassroots organizers, and creative writers have consciously written to intervene in the affairs of their communities despite their outsider status.

Raccoon coats, Stutz Bearcats, and militant Garveyites parading down Lenox Avenue. Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston exchanging quips at the Dark Tower salon. These are the some of the best-remembered scenes of the Harlem Renaissance, a movement of African American artists--literary, musical, and visual--who personified the \"New Negro\" and transformed uptown Manhattan into an international headquarters of Black intellectual life from the late nineteen-teens to the early nineteen-thirties. This graduate seminar will reexamine Harlem's self-modernizing rebirth on the centennial of Jean Toomer's \"Cane\" (1923), the movement's most treasured text, exploring the intricate histories behind the iconic images. We'll study poems, stories, novels, essays, and memoirs by a varied group of writers (Hughes, Hurston, Toomer, W.E.B. Du Bois, Jesse Fauset, Nella Larsen, Claude McKay, Sterling Brown) and their collective debt to pioneering jazz and blues musicians (Ellington, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Fats Waller) and scene-setting visual artists (Aaron Douglas, Jacob Lawrence, Gwendolyn Bennett). We'll compare these figures' visions of the Great Migration and the Black Metropolis, racial pride and racial passing, Jazz Age sexuality and respectable secrecy, avant-garde experiments and modernist primitivisms. Finally, we'll sample some of the most important recent chapters in Harlem Renaissance scholarship, from studies of the movement's American cultural nationalism (David Levering Lewis and George Hutchinson), to theories of its channels to Black diasporan travel and translation (Brent Hayes Edwards and Michelle Stephens), to intimate archival histories of the everyday Afro-modernisms of \"riotous Black girls, troublesome women, and queer radicals\" (Saidiya Hartman and Daphne Brooks).

The Reed-Kellogg system of diagramming is a method of learning grammar by creating pictures, or maps, of sentences. These pictures show the logical relations between words, phrases, and clauses, and they illustrate the choices writers are making as they craft individual sentences. Using a recent textbook by Eugene Moutoux, we will learn to diagram sentences both famous and ordinary, both contemporary and of historical interest. Our aims will be (1) to learn both the rules and the peculiarities of English grammar, (2) to understand how the structure of a sentence can influence its meaning, and (3) to use this knowledge productively in crafting and revising our own prose. By the end of the course, students should be able to diagram just about any sentence in English, whatever the genre or time period, including their own.

Buck was the first American woman to win the Award and the third American overall (playwright Eugene O'Neill won it in 1936). Both were not only highly esteemed writers; Lewis a satirist of American classes and cultural manners, and Buck largely known for her realistic works about Asia (she grew up in China), the theme of the pull of tradition against rebellion, and her biographies of her missionary parents. Both were popular as well: Lewis's novels Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, Mantrap, Dodsworth, Ann Vickers, and Cass Timberlane were made into films. Buck's novels The Good Earth, Dragon Seed, China Sky, and Pavilion of Women were made into films as well as her script for what turned out to be Leo McCarey's last film, Satan Never Sleeps. Except for Lewis's dystopian novel about a fascist takeover of the United States, It Can Happen Here, the works of neither author are as read as they were at the authors' height of fame. This course is an exploration of some the major and lesser-known works of Lewis and Buck, and a consideration of their status in American letters. Why did their best works make the impact they did?

From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's The Human Stain, Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections) and popular films (Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing and The Cohen brothers' The Big Lebowski) to the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_315","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Topics in Literature","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3114","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ELIT_315_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Myers, Bernadette"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[13,15]}]},"description":"Topics: themes, formal problems, literary genres, special subjects (e.g., the American West, American autobiographical writing).

Yet while writers and artists set out with a purpose-a clear vision and intention-those motives may change or evolve throughout the creative process. In Bird by Bird, for instance, Anne Lamott likens the writing process to \"watching a Polaroid develop.\" As a writer, she claims, \"[y]ou can't-and, in fact, you're not supposed to-know exactly what the picture is going to look like until it has finished developing.\" It is only after \"the portrait comes into focus, [that] you begin to notice all the props surrounding these people, and you begin to understand how props define us and comfort us, and show us what we value and what we need, and who we think we are.\" Likewise, in At Work, Annie Leibovitz recalls staging the portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono in \"their apartment in the Dakota early in December\" of 1980. Initially, Leibovitz had a clear vision and mission in mind; she conceived of the photo as a moment of stolen intimacy: \"a simple kiss in a jaded time.\" But everything changed in an instant-in the blink of an eye. That night, Lennon was shot and killed while returning to the Dakota. In retrospect, recounts Leibovitz, the portrait \"looks like a last kiss.\" This is a course about stories and storytelling. What stories do we tell and what stories are we told?? How does art (written, visual, and performative) enable us to share our experiences-to bring purpose and meaning to our lives and to the lives of others? Throughout this course, we will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a broad range of discourse communities, including (but not limited to) art history, sociology, psychology, film studies, and cultural studies. We will read, write, and share (both instructor and students) expository prose (personal, persuasive, and interpretative) to consider our perception of and place within the visual world.

The paradoxical pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet has real-world consequences: from climate change to increasing income inequality to stagnant and declining quality of life for most of us to the ongoing mass extinction of species not deemed economically useful to us, but whose loss simplifies ecosystems to the point of collapse. If these trends continue, we will face very difficult times ecologically and socio-politically. One alternative to infinite-planet economic theory is Ecological Economics, which can be described as economics as if the laws of thermodynamics are true and apply to us. Alone among disciplines with aspiration to analytic rigor, the field of economics has remained unaffected by the thermodynamic revolution that transformed the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, even history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This failure to take physical law into account is one great source of our society's environmental (and social, and political) problems. Ecological economics thus represents the continuation of the thermodynamic revolution begun in the 1880s. This course is designed to give you an appropriate grounding in the fundamental assumptions, the conceptual novelties, and the distinctive tools of analysis that comprise this emergent school of economic theory, while placing this theorizing in historical and ecological context. We'll pay particular attention to how the precepts and practice of Ecological Economics illuminate the largest challenge facing humans today, the necessity of developing an ecologically sustainable society, one that is sized to the limits of our finite planet.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_110","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Environmental Issues","catalogNumber":"ENST 1150","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338378","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[20,60]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338395","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[59,60]}]},"description":"This course examines the science behind current environmental issues, with emphasis on Ecology and Conservation.

The main outcome of the course is a completed literature review and a well-defined, researchable question on a topic of your choice. Before beginning a study, researchers must develop a compelling and meaningful research question. This question should be grounded in existing knowledge, informed by prior research, and justified by gaps in our current understanding. Researchers communicate this rationale through a literature review, which serves to contextualize, justify, and motivate their research. Writing and revising a literature review is a key part of this process, as the act of writing helps clarify and refine your thinking. Class topics include advanced database searching, evaluating the quality and types of sources, summarizing and analyzing literature, constructing logical and persuasive argu  ments, managing references and data, visualizing information, writing with clarity and style, and using generative AI as a tool for research and writing. You will learn and practice these skills through readings, homework, class discussions, and activities.

Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex dynamics that are driving rapid deployment of renewables and present both opportunities and challenges to decarbonization in the years ahead. Through the lenses of business, policy, and engineering, students in RESET will learn through classroom lectures from faculty, industry professionals, and policy-makers; group discussions; field trips to solar arrays and a landfill gas power plant; and a final team project where students serve as consultants to a local government, proposing an on-site solar strategy, local policy changes to support decarbonization, and more. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of many large-scale issues influencing decarbonization, as well as the real-world factors that are necessary for designing, financing, and building new renewable energy projects.    Why renewables and the grid? Decarbonizing the electric grid paired with electrifying sectors that currently run on fossil fuels - including transportation, heating, buildings, and manufacturing and construction - together have the potential to reduce more than 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The global energy transition, which was already well-underway, accelerated in 2022 due to a combination of countries' energy security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and expanding climate ambition resulting in new policies that support renewable energy, including the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. The International Energy Agency's 2022 Renewables report found that renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity expansion over the next five years, overtaking coal to become the largest source of global electricity by early 2025.

This question has been on the minds of Americans for generations, yet we still are often left without an answer. This course explores that question by proposing another set of questions: what is an immigrant? How are certain people included or excluded from this category?, and why is immigration still a concern in the 21st century? We will explore these questions by examining cultural materials such as film, music, photographs, and ephemera alongside the social, legal, and political discourses which framed immigration throughout the long 20th century. We will learn about refugees from Europe, migrants from Latin America, and those deemed undesirable from around the world as they travelled to our own fine city of Saint Louis. Starting in the late 19th century this course will untangle the legislative, cultural, and political actions that impact the discussions around immigration and migration today. A large component of the course will explore the cultural productions which overlapped with the social and political discourses and ensured the longevity and spread of those ideas far beyond the homes and halls of the powerful and into the streets and theaters of the nation. Examining the cultural artifacts that individuals and groups produced for the public allows us to practice historical thinking, material cultural analysis, and draw connections between different time periods and emergent concerns. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to examine primary source material alongside selected texts which explore the various immigration issues related to concerns around mobility including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and progressive and liberal politics. In the end students will walk away from this course with an understanding of the historical forces which have shaped American immigration from the calls of Benjamin Franklin to exclude Germans to the cries of Build the Wall in the 21st century.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_357","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"All Measures Short of War","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3139","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_HISTORY_357_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Knapp, Krister D"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[14,17]}]},"description":"This course focuses on the return of great power competition in the 21st century.

Through a consideration of the strategic, military, political, economic, and intelligence dynamics germane to foreign policy and national security, it will examine the hypothesis that the United States is not likely to go to hot war with any of these four nations but instead resort to what President Roosevelt in another context and time famously called all measures short of war -- in other words, engaging one another through new technologies such as cyber, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, hypersonics, biotechnology, and other means that have come to demarcate a hybrid battlefield in an age of hostile competition. As such, the course will assess the recent past, current state, and likely future of American power in the new global security environment.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_4001","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Directed Fieldwork in Historical and Archival Professions","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 4161","units":4,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_HISTORY_4001_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Pegg, Mark G"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]}]},"description":"A fieldwork project under the direction of a faculty member from the Department of History.

Widespread optimism that these transfers of power would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become failed states requiring foreign assistance to develop properly.  This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era.  By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_2118","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"First-Year Seminar: Angels, Prostitutes and Chicas Modernas: Women in Latin American History","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 2117","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_HISTORY_2118_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Montano, Diana J."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[900,1070],"seats":[4,15]}]},"description":"Women have been active players in the construction of Latin American nations.

Western civilization may be characterized as one long debate on the holy. In no other civilization did this debate about the limits of the sacred and the profane -- this constant effort at trying to grasp the divine through word and deed -- last continuously for more than 5000 years. To argue over the holy is to argue over the very nature of how to live a life, from the most mundane daily activity to the most sublime act of the imagination. It is to argue over how politics, economics, art, philosophy, literature, and religion are realized in a society. Apart from many types of polytheism, we study the three great world monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We study the ancient cultures of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the empires of Alexander the Great and imperial Rome, the Christianization of the Roman Empire and the rise of Islam, the early medieval world in the North Sea and the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople, the formation of Latin Christendom and the papal monarchy, the Crusades and the reaction of the Islamic lands, concepts of individuality, the persecution of Jews and heretics, chivalry and peasant servitude, the Mongol Empire, the Black Death and the devastation of the 14th century, the Renaissance in Italy and the Protestant reformation, the hunt for witches and the scientific revolution, and the medieval origins of the African diaspora and the European conquest of the Americas. What defined being human -- and so a man, a woman, or a child -- over five millennia? Fundamental questions of this course include the following: What is Western civilization? When do the characteristics defined as Western come together as a coherent phenomenon? What, then, is historical truth? This course (through lectures, reading primary sources, discussion sections, and essay writing) gives the student a learned background in almost 5000 years of history. This is an introductory course for the history major and minor.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MEDH_385","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"What is Medical Humanities?","catalogNumber":"MEDH 3000","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_MEDH_385_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Salas, Luis Alejandro"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[840,920],"seats":[13,20]}]},"description":"What is medical humanities?

Property is damaged and stolen, lives are lost, and law, order, and justice evolves.  This course taps into that ongoing reality by centering the herstorical evolution of female crime, highlighting women and girls of many kinds across time and spaces of America.  It moves across centuries (through to the contemporary period) probing within and far beyond icons to unveil the gendered nature of crime and moreover to empower students to see and trace everyday female criminality that ignited across racial, ethnic, as well as lines of age in the winding path of American history.  While men and boys dominate public and even scholarly expectations of crime and carceral conversations for many, students will leave this course with a far more rigorous understanding of the herstories gained by taking serious the types of crimes that women and girls acted out by exploring: robbery, assault, infanticide, larceny, murder, arson, prostitution, serial killers, and drug-related crimes. As well as going further to probe state and federal power through carceral medicine - showing the interior world of female prisoners, physicians, the movement of females into asylums'' and mental state hospitals, incarceration based on insanity while going further to examine births, illnesses, and death of women and teens in jails and prisons. Students will be likewise pushed to engage America's timeline of race, gender, and executions that includes women and girls.  Racialized and gendered criminality, law enforcement violence, healthcare and deathcare in prisons are critical public health issues that students can better understand the complicated evolutions by deeply probing the herstorical lives of women, girls, and crime through this course.

By studying how peoples of the region have debated issues of race and racialization, from the Abbasid era to the contemporary moment, we come to realize the legibility and urgency of race as an analytics in Middle East studies. In considering pre-modern and modern articulations of race across the region, we begin to understand how race has functioned as a technology of power and hierarchization, and its intersectional role in forming categories of ethnicity, nationality, or even gender and sexuality.

Through this interdisciplinary course on culture, art, design, religion and society, students will be introduced to and gain a deeper insight into the rich diversity of South Asia through the study of the architecture of its significant sacred places. We will take a journey through the Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Temples; the Islamic Mosque; the Sikh Gurudwara; the Zoroastrian Fire Temple; the Jewish Synagogue; and the Christian Church, tracing the evolution of these places of worship from the Indus Valley Civilization to Pre-Colonial times. Through visuals, readings, and discussions, students will learn about the different architectural styles and motifs used in sacred buildings and how they came about. We will explore the inter-relationships between the design elements through the lens of political, social, religious, regional, artistic, and technological influences and understand the ways in which evolving design principles reflect these influences overtime. This course will be of interest to students of languages and cultures, architecture, archeology,  art history, history, preservation, religion, and South Asian culture, among others.  Please note: At the end of the semester, students will go on a field trip to experience the diverse sacred architecture in the St. Louis region.

In this, cinema has strong correlations with neoliberalism, the political doctrine tied to free-market reform, democratization and privatization, among other ideas. The class will be based on the study and discussion of key films of the period to develop two themes. First, we will study the way in which cinema has become a cultural practice central to the discussion of the effects of neoliberalism in the region, as well as the opposition to neoliberalism. Topics in this regard will include: the social impact of free market reforms, growing economic and social inequality, the emergence of working class, Black and indigenous communities, the rise and fall of the New Left, the creation of new elites and other related themes. Second, we will study the way in which films are made and distributed and the changes on film production over the past decades. Topics will include the privatization of production and exhibition, the role of home video and streaming, the importance of film festivals and the move from national to translational scenes of production.

The films hail from Italy, France, Britain, Spain, Sweden, the PRC, Hong Kong, and Japan. Many canonical films, directors, and composers from this era of intense cinephilia are included. Among the directors are Bergman, Truffaut, Godard, Varda, Fellini, Bertolucci, Kurosawa, Yimou, Wong Kar-wai, Almódovar, and Greenaway. Screenings will be held in St. Louis’ very own art house cinema: the Hi-Pointe Theatre, located near campus and convenient to the South Campus Shuttle. A $30 pass will provide access to all screenings for the semester.

This course therefore invites us to consider how canons form, whom they marginalize, and what we can learn by looking beyond them.Classical music has played an important role in forming listeners' beliefs about music and the performing arts more generally: the importance of self-expression, the roles and responsibilities of creator and performer, the extent to which art can be detached from its context, and how (indeed whether) we can both enjoy and critique an artistic tradition.In this course, we will learn to engage with classical music through critical listening and historical investigation. This course is not a historical survey. Rather, we will explore rich case studies that build our critical and interpretive skills, and that use classical music to illuminate broader questions in the humanities. Our readings will expose us to a variety of writing styles and perspectives, including historical figures, present-day critics, and musicological scholars. We will also attend at least one on- or off-campus performance and reflect on how it connects to our course.This course does not require any prior musical experience, knowledge of classical music specifically, or the ability to read music.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MUSIC_3021","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Music","title":"Music of the African Diaspora","catalogNumber":"MUSIC 3021","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-339281","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Eldridge Stewart, Lauren Elizabeth"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[24,25]}]},"description":"This course explores musical cross-fertilization between the African continent and South America, the Caribbean, and Europe.

Students are placed on a listener's journey of discovery to find the nature of music through philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, biology, architecture and the structure of sound itself. Music theory topics both simple and advanced are discussed in ways appropriate for the novice as well as the advanced student. The course functions as a music theory and music literature study through the lens of the humanities. The course embraces both culture and nature, seeking out the grand-scale patterns that help explain the qualities of our musical endeavor.

How do the affordances of a digital tool amplify or suppress aspects of a source story? What new insights into familiar stories can we generate with radical adaptation? To engage these questions, this studio seminar blends humanistic scholarship with critical making, theatrical practice, and interdisciplinary, team-based agile development processes. Each two-week sprint engages a different immersive, theatricalized context, asking students to envision how the tools utilized therein might illuminate latent aspects of familiar stories. Topics include spatial computing/AR/VR/ XR, immersive theatre, theme parks, and cultural institutions/ museums. Additionally, this course utilizes critical making as an epistemology, wherein the site of knowledge creation is the process of devising an object, tool, performance, or installation in conversation with a discipline's critical apparatus. Accordingly, course-long projects will find students selecting and using immersive tools-digital, analog, or both-to radically adapt a familiar story, broadly construed. Importantly, while technological skills are welcome, they are not required. Students are encouraged to envision gloriously and scope effectively as they design a hypothetical or prototyped research project and complementary critical engagement.

But the most popular combination of music and drama continues to be the Broadway musical. In this course, we will look at some of the most popular musicals of the 20th and 21st centuries. We will watch stage and film versions of these musicals, focusing on how their deployment of song, scenery, dialogue, and dance coalesce to create a cohesive narrative, convey sociopolitical commentary, and evoke an emotional response. We will also look at the literary and historical sources of these musicals to help us understand the process by which their composers adapted them for performance. At the same time, we will consider how musicals have evolved both to include a greater diversity of race and gender identities and to engage with new cultural and media contexts. Finally, we will discover together why the musical — so often our first encounter with live performance — continues to capture our imaginations and inspire a lifelong love of the theatre. This course will focus on developing the following Literacies for Life and Career: applied problem solving; communication dexterity; creative and innovative practices; critical and interpretative skills; historical, social, and contextual understanding; integrative thinking; and systematic inquiry.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-60437","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Jewish American Theater and Performance","catalogNumber":"DRAMA 3312","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-342660","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Ullman, Alex Jay"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[2,12]}]},"description":"This course explores Jewish identity through theatre and performance in the 20th and 21st century United States.

We will treat theatre space as a socially generated phenomenon produced in many cultures that dynamically links performers and audiences. Theatre space will be used as a gathering concept through which many facets of performance culture can be examined, including architecture, scenography, script, and the physical features of embodied communication. Beyond this, theatre space also illuminates myriad aspects of the cultural practice of theatre, including social difference (especially gender and class), economic activity, and political representation. Distinct theories of historical space will be introduced and examples of historical theatre space will include Ancient Greece, Edo Japan, Neo-Classical France, Golden Age Spain, Classical India, and twentieth-century Environmental Scenography. The core of the reading for this course will be representative or exemplary playscripts that help open up interpretive approaches to historical theatre and performance space.

The signature property of a black hole is that your can get in, but not out. In this first-year seminar, we discuss what is currently known about black holes, starting from Einstein's theories about space, time, and gravity, through the first observational evidence for black holes, to the latest images of the shadows cast by black holes taken with the largest telescopes on earth. This class is designed to bend your mind when figuring out why clocks run slower when approaching the edge of a black hole, what could be at the center of a black hole or even at the other side. At the same time, we will discuss the inner workings of the most advanced telescopes that astronomers have developed to study black holes, and the strategies astronomers employ to develop ever more sensitive instruments. Also expect a fair bit of astronomy in this class, when we discuss how black holes form, when and how they grow, and which roles they play in cosmic eco-systems such as the Milky Way Galaxy. This first-year seminar adopts a flipped class/socratic discussion structure. The students are asked to read a wide variety of texts, including texts from the current literature, and to present and to discuss some of the material in class. The class assumes no background in math; at the same time, we will discuss some of the math that brings Einstein's theories of space and time to life.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_PHYSICS_193","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Physics","title":"Focused Physics I","catalogNumber":"PHYSICS 1760","units":4,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_PHYSICS_193_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Tikhonov, Mikhail"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[37,50]}],"lab":[{"id":"SEC_202505_PHYSICS_193_A_U","number":"A","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Medeiros da Rosa, Augusto"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Fri"],"time":[780,830],"seats":[37,50]}]},"description":"The first course in a two-semester calculus-based introduction to physics.

The course includes interactive discussions, group activities, and reading assignments. Activities not completed in class will be assigned as homework. The course involves activities specifically focused on numerical literacy, where students work with datasets, analyze trends, and create visual representations. These activities ensure that students not only engage with the narratives of historical figures but also develop practical skills in applied numeracy to explore and present data-driven insights. The final project involves creating and presenting a poster on a physicist not covered in the course.

It is also both shaped by, and helps constitute the meaning of, gender. This course asks the following questions: How has work been theorized in the history of political thought, and how ought we conceptualize work today? How does the gendering of work naturalize certain forms of labor, such as domestic work, mothering, and gestation? How might individuals resist these processes, thus remaking the meaning of work? And finally, what do we want the future of work to be? This course is divided into four parts, which track these four questions. First, we will read canonical works in political theory that frame the debate on work. Then, in part two we will move beyond gender-free conceptions of work, looking at kinds of work that have been quintessentially defined as “women’s work,” including domestic work, sex work, and gestational labor. Third, we will turn to the politics of resistance and the refusal of work, focusing on feminist refusals. Here, we look at social movements and moments in feminist history that challenge the naturalization of gendered labor, including the Wages for Housework movement and the Women’s Strike. Finally, we will conclude with a unit on the future of work that once again centers work’s gendered dimensions.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_POLSCI_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"Independent Work","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 5006","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_POLSCI_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202505_POLSCI_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is an independent study taken under the supervision of an instructor in the department.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_POLSCI_5017","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"Interest Groups & Social Movements","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 5057","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338866","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Christenson, Dino Pinterpe"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Thu"],"time":[780,950],"seats":[4,20]}]},"description":"The formation, evolution and political influence of organized interests and social movements in the US.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-60457","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"International Organizations","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 3177","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-341557","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Bowersox, Zachary Hume"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":null}]},"description":"The students participating in this class will have an opportunity to answer some of the most pressing questions about governance in the international system today.

Legislative enactments have also established rights with respect to voting. Each extension of voting rights has been a product of and resulted in social and political change. This course will examine the interplay of law and politics in the right to vote. The course will begin with the study of constitutional foundations, statutory protections and case law. We will then apply these principles to current issues in voting rights, including voter registration, voter identification, provisional ballots, voting machines, access for people with disabilities, felony disenfranchisement, voter suppression and voter fraud.

Along the way, we consider answers to several interesting questions: Why are some people generally more empathic than others? Are there cultural differences in levels of this trait? To what extent is empathy an emotional or cognitive phenomenon?

Module 1 includes a concise overview and review of basics about linguistics, Hispanic linguistics, the nature of each linguistic subsystem, the history of the Spanish language, and characteristics of present-day regional varieties of Spanish. Module 2 focuses on semantics and pragmatics, complemented by an exploration of variation in vocabulary throughout the Spanish-speaking world, such as how the English word popcorn may translate as palomitas, canguil, cancha, pochoclo, among various other options, depending on the Spanish-speaking region in question. Module 3 introduces students to sociolinguistics as applied to the Spanish-speaking world, beginning with key concepts such as sociolinguistic variable and concluding with student-led analyses of samples of Spanish day-to-day interactions, emphasizing the legitimacy and value of variation in light of what might be relegated as standard. Module 4 explores a selection of other areas of Spanish applied linguistics, which include teaching Spanish as a second or heritage language and dual immersion programs with Spanish and English in the United States.

It focuses on the main linguistic subsystems: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), the formation and use of words (morphology), and the formation and structure of sentences (syntax). When working with each linguistic subsystem, students are provided with opportunities to reflect on and improve their own abilities in Spanish, such as with regard to how mood (indicative versus subjunctive) and aspect (preterit versus imperfect) work in the Spanish verbal system. Similarities and differences between Spanish and other languages, such as English, are highlighted. The course also provides students with an introduction to the history of Spanish in its evolution from Latin as one of many Romance languages (a diachronic view) and an exploration of various regional varieties of Spanish today (a synchronic view).

As we progress in our understanding of these multifaceted and varied responses, we will examine the two most important ethical choices that the Hispanic peoples of both sides of the Atlantic Ocean have had in front of them at different points in time: (1) the choice between inclusion and exclusion; and (2) the concerted decision to either memorialize or forget history and the consequences of having chosen to exclude or include certain individuals, ideas, religions or cultural aspects of society. The consideration of these two choices -- as they appear represented in laws, texts and images -- will help us acquire the ability to better understand the challenges and dilemmas that the various Hispanic peoples have encountered in the past and the decisions they continue to make in the present moment when confronted with diversity. Each module of this course will be anchored by an official document or policy that rubber stamped the decision to include, exclude, remember, or forget those who were different because of their origins, their religion, their language, their way of living, or their political choices. Examples of these laws or decrees are the Capitulations of Granada, the Edict of Expulsion of 1492, the New Laws of the Indies, the laws of land confiscation of the 19th century, the persecutions and censorship of the dictatorial regimes in both Spain and Latin America, and the recent Spanish law for the recovery of historical memory. Also, each module will begin in the past and end in the present, with an exploration of the contemporary consequences of those laws and policies. These diachronic studies will contribute to inform the analysis of both social issues and cultural artifacts, and they will enrich the class presentations and discussions.

The two most important questions we will try to answer here, with the help of some recent discoveries in the fields of the neurosciences and the study of emotions, are the following: Why were they unforgettable? And how were the characteristics that made them unforgettable used to modify the minds of those who received them either orally or in written form?

While the founding of the city of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, dates back to the Roman empire (i.e., the first century BCE), the city of Madrid, the capital of Spain, was established during the 15th century around a small fortification developed during Al-Andalus, soon becoming the political center of the Spanish Empire during the 16th century.

This seminar invites students to engage critically with the historical and cultural forces that defined an era of transformation and its enduring legacies in Latin America. The Cuban Revolution, the rise of student movements, and the expansion of mass media and consumer culture shaped cultural production and political, aesthetic, and intellectual debates in the region in contradictory ways: Latin Americanism clashed with the Americanization of Life; autochthonism contested mass culture; radical aesthetics denounced artistic formalism; counterculture suspected the established male intellectual elite. Through a cultural history lens, the course begins with a survey of the era's political, cultural, and social dimensions—Cold War geopolitics, decolonization, and the intersections of modernity and modernization. Students will then delve into four thematic units: 1) The Republic of Letters: Exploring the Boom, the role of literature, and transnational journals and publishing networks; 2) The Factographic Form: Investigating experimental films, the testimonio genre, and revolutionary poetry; 3) Mass Media, Modernity, and the Popular: Analyzing comics, visual culture, the nueva canción, and debates on popular culture and technology; and 4) Streets, Posters, and Theater: Studying public spaces as sites of cultural and political expression.

In the spring term, students will be supervised by faculty mentors in an independent study as they carry out their research, analyze their findings, construct the thesis document, and defend their work in a formal defense. Students may be required to share their work in additional venues, such as departmental symposiums or institution-wide undergraduate research events. Successful completion of both terms of coursework and completion of a defendable thesis paper satisfies the capstone requirement for the Sociology major.  Additionally, students may count three of the six-credit sequence's hours toward the major's upper-level requirements.This course is open to Sociology majors only. Students who are interested in the thesis program should contact the department's Director of Undergraduate Studies and/or the Academic Coordinator - as well as their planned faculty mentor(s) - prior to their planned enrollment. Students will be waitlisted until program acceptance and faculty approval is confirmed.

Upon completing the course, students are expected to be capable of handling optimization-related challenges they encounter in statistics and machine learning research. This includes appropriately formulating an optimization problem, selecting or developing an efficient optimization algorithm for it, and analyzing the algorithm, based on structural properties such as convexity, smoothness, and sparsity, as well as specific settings such as online, distributed, and memory-limited contexts. Prerequisites: Fluency with reasoning and analysis using linear algebra and probability is required (MATH 309 and Math/SDS 493 or Math/SDS 3211). Students are expected to be familiar with the basics of at least one computing platform/ programming language, such as Matlab, Julia, Python, and R.

But in the past few decades, scholars and activists have begun to challenge the notion that disability is a tragedy to be medically prevented or inspirationally overcome.  These scholars have instead focused their attention on the social aspects of disability: how it came to be constructed as a category of identity, the physical and institutional barriers that have excluded disabled people from public life, and the distortion of disabled lives within the mainstream representation. More recently, writers have turned their attention to the way disability has been defined though norms of race, gender, and sexuality. These intersections will be the focus of this course. From the diagnoses of hysteria to debates over selective abortion and the recent proliferation of breast cancer memoirs, we will consider how the politics of disability has both complemented and complicated the usual goals of feminism. We will also explore some of the ways that disability studies as a discipline has redefined and in turn been shaped by the fields of queer theory, masculinity studies, and critical race theory. We will consider how deviant genders have been the target of medicalization, the relationship between corrective surgery and compulsory gendering, the desexualization and hypersexualization of disabled bodies, and the role that medicine has played in justifying colonial conquest and perpetuating racial inequalities.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

Global resistance to citizenship, borders, carceral violence and gender injustice makes these question unavoidable for queer and feminist thinkers and activists. Through our study of queer theory and abolitionist politics, we will consider the costs of exclusion from, as well as inclusion in, citizenship regimes transnationally and state discourses of LGBT recognition. The course considers connections between heteronormativity and citizenship; carceral and gender violence; state support for the white, middle-class nuclear family; the policing of intimacy; queer liberation and abolition democracy; gender anarchy and political anarchism; and the surveillance of gender and the political economy of prisons and policing. In each of these areas, we will attend to the politics of transgender recognition; gay imperialism; campaigns to defund the police; legislative violence against transgender youth; and overlaps between global abolitionist movements and the struggle for bodily autonomy and sovereignty.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_498","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Supervised Reading and Research","catalogNumber":"WGSS 4980","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_WGSS_498_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"This course is designed for students who are pursuing an independent study project as part of the Department Honors Program.

This diverse methodology focuses on pragmatically conceptualizing, collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data and approaches in a single or series of studies (Creswell & Clark, 2007). The fundamental strength of mixed methods designs is that using and mixing quantitative and qualitative approaches can produce a better and more comprehensive understanding of the area of study than using a single method. Mixed methodologies are also suitable for capturing the multi-faceted and dynamic complexities of social phenomena and have the potential to advance the generation of knowledge and actions to find practical and sustainable solutions to real-world problems. This doctoral-level course introduces students to the fundamental elements, characteristics, debates, approaches and designs of mixed method research and its applications to real-world problems. In this course students will develop and apply skills to critically appraise the quality and rigor of mixed methods studies and write a mixed method grant proposal.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-61604","school":"Brown School","department":"","title":"MSP Elective Practicum II","catalogNumber":"SPGN 6027","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-351454","number":"1","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Jovanovich, Joe"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,10]}]},"description":"This course provides supervised experience in application of social policy techniques through work in an agency or other organization.

The second is to introduce students -- via guest lectures by school of medicine and engineering faculty, to some of the fascinating and challenging ongoing research in these areas. The course is challenging because students at this early stage, by and large, lack the knowledge base to understand either the engineering / biological aspects of the topical areas or the research being presented.

Imaging systems are important in many scientific and medical applications and may be designed for one specific application or for a range of applications. Performance is quantified for any given task through an understanding of the statistical model for the imaging data, the data processing algorithm used, and a measure of accuracy or error. Optimal processing is based on statistical decision theory and estimation theory; performance bounds include the receiver operating characteristic and Cramer-Rao bounds. Bayesian methods often lead to ideal observers. Extensions of methods from finite-dimensional spaces to function space are fundamental for many imaging applications.

The process of making data-informed, or even data-driven, decisions are called data science. Such decision-making process requires the leaders of organizations understand the technological platform of data acquisition, storage and analysis. It also requires leadership to be familiar with various data-driven decision-making techniques, their advantages, and their disadvantages. This course introduces this topic and helps leaders to utilize data to better manage their organizations. The class will start with a general introduction of data science and provides several frameworks to classify data science into multiple sub-fields. Participants will have a general understanding of data science and the organization structure of various data science teams. The class then dives into two major sub-fields of data science: causal inference and machine learning. For each sub-field, participants will learn the basic concepts behind it, how to apply the techniques in this sub-field to different problems, and how to build a team that is specialized in these techniques. Participants will also learn the advantages and disadvantages of each sub-field, and how to combine techniques from multiple sub-fields to solve complex problems. Last, this class will touch upon the topics between data science and society, including data privacy, fairness in machine learning, and adverse usage of machine learning models. Participantswill learn the ethical questions behind using different data science techniques.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_DAT-B69_8563","school":"Olin Business School","department":"","title":"Data Visualization for Business Insights","catalogNumber":"DAT 6563","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_DAT-B69_8563_21_S","number":"21","term":"2025 Fall Half A","instructor":["Lin, Gary Chensin"],"delivery":"Online","days":["Wed"],"time":[1140,1230],"seats":null}]},"description":"Data Visualization has become a core skill set to derive business insights in the data rich business world.

Experts estimate approximately that 90% of the data in organizations is in the form of unstructured datasets, including images, texts, customer reviews, videos, and so on. Organizations would like to use these datasets to improve their business. Moreover, deep learning has a significant advantage over other machine learning algorithms in that it does not require extracting features manually prior to applying algorithms. Leading-edge organizations are also expecting business analysts and managers to be familiar with applying deep learning models to solve business problems using unstructured data. This course is recommended but is not required for MS-Business Analytics (MSA) students. It will teach students to build deep learning models for solving business problems using Python libraries (e.g., Keras, Tensorflow). We will cover a range of algorithms from neural networks foundations to convolutional and recurrent network structures; these will be applied in domains such as marketing, customer behavior, and predicting finance risks. Students will better understand the practical use of deep learning with the use of the following five questions: (1) How can unstructured datasets be visualized and analyzed? (2) What are neural networks, and how can they be optimized? (3) What is the deep learning model, and how can it be used in business? (4) Which deep learning structure should be used for a given business problem? (5) How can a deep learning model be developed to solve business problems? In summary, the course will expose students to prevalent business applications of deep learning in different domains (e.g., customer analytics, supply chain analytics, healthcare analytics, financial technology analytics, accounting analytics, talent analytics).

The origins of this field, which is often referred to as revenue management, were in the airline industry during the late 1980s. The prototypical question is how a firm should set and update pricing and make product availability decisions across its various selling channels in order to maximize its profitability. In the airline industry, tickets for the same flight may be sold at many different fares, and availability may change as a function of purchase restrictions, forecasted future demand, and the number of unsold seats. The adoption of such systems has transformed the transportation and hospitality industries, and it is increasingly important in retail, telecommunications, entertainment, financial services, health care, and manufacturing as well as online advertising, online retailing, and online markets. In parallel, pricing and revenue optimization has become a rapidly expanding practice in consulting services and a growing area of software and IT development. The ultimate goal of this course is for students to learn to identify and exploit opportunities for revenue optimization in different business contexts. The topics covered in this course are either directly or indirectly related to customer segmentation, demand modeling, and tactical price optimization.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_MGT-B53_460L","school":"Olin Business School","department":"","title":"Introduction to Social Entrepreneurship","catalogNumber":"MGT 4603","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_MGT-B53_460L_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Cameron, Heather Ellen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[30,40]}]},"description":"Social entrepreneurs use innovative, market-based tools and responses to solve social and environmental problems.

Students will consider ways in which their artistic practices constitute and create research and how these processes condition and inform their artistic voice. Second, this seminar builds tools for presenting a distinct voice on behalf of one's work. Specifically, the student is introduced to the way other contemporary practitioners write and talk about their own work -- through published books, chapters, interviews, online materials, and more -- and how this writing differs from both criticism and art historical writing. Each candidate creates their own personal research archive and explores how writing can expand and advance their practice.

How the bathroom is designed, which technologies are used in it, and what functions it serves depend on the specific social and cultural needs of a particular time and place. The bathroom of today, with its flush toilets, showers, baths, and sinks, is a rather new formation. This seminar will explore the history of the bathroom and its design across time and space, challenging students to reconsider exactly what a bathroom is and inviting them to think about new ways of designing it. Weekly readings will introduce students to the ways in which changing hygienic norms, the spread of a “culture of flushing,” and access to new materials and technologies shaped how architects designed bathrooms from Roman communal toilets and public baths to Japanese high-tech “Washlets” and prefabricated bath units.

The rendered spaces were both religious and secular, ancient and modern all within the two-dimensional canvas surface. The masterpieces, often intertwining real and imagined spaces were depicted as hyper-real with tremendous amounts of focused detail on the specific setting, lighting, ornament, historical elements, and artifacts. Perspectival linework and architectural frameworks were often drawn onto the canvas at the start. In this course, students will build architectural models of selected paintings exploring their formal composition, materiality, light sources, staging, and details. The models, crafted out of paper, paint, and marmorizzazione will prompt the class examine the role of architecture in painting while engaging the fantastical spaces within the architectural imaginary of Italian Renaissance Painting.

Almost every week for the first half of the semester, students visit a different area of the city, with each trip highlighting some theme or issue related to the built environment. These include topics such as architecture, planning, American history, investment and disinvestment, community character and values, race, transportation, immigrant communities, and future visions. Running parallel to this, students will be involved in an ongoing relationship with one particular struggling neighborhood, in which students will attend community meetings and get to know and become involved with the people of the community in a variety of ways. Students learn to look below the surface and beyond the single obvious story for multiple stories to discover complexity, contradictions and paradoxes. They also come to consider the complex ways in which architecture and the built environment can affect or be affected by a host of other disciplines.

Today, one billion people live in informal cities (36% of the world's population) and this is expected to grow another one billion over the next 30 years.  As it is currently evolving, the informal city is an urban phenomenon set up within the planned city's territory and increasingly an integral part of it--often comprising up to 75% of the city and one of the elements of urban morphology that shapes city design.  Thus, it is no longer possible to accept a concept of the informal city that centered on negative parameters (ghettos/slums/poverty/crime, etc.), but there is a need to find sustainable spatial solutions to integrate these settlements into the formal urban/architectural tissue leading to the dissolution of urban and symbolic boundaries between the informal areas and formal districts.

Noguchi's ceiling was one of three built lunar landscapes inspired by his incarceration at the Poston Internment Center, which he voluntarily entered in 1942. Noguchi created dozens of plaster models of lunar landscapes; however, only three were built: a ceiling in the Time and Life Building in New York, the interior wall of the SS Argentina Ocean Liner, and the American Stove Company ceiling in St. Louis. The American Stove ceiling, though only recently uncovered in 2016, is the only lunar landscape still in existence today. The earlier models, often misunderstood as sculptures, were proposals for spaces meant to be inhabited. Noguchi identified himself primarily as a sculptor and had no architectural training; however, he commanded an extraordinary understanding of space. He designed spaces at various scales, from the body to urban design proposals to outer space, as well as a range of functions – furniture, theater sets, memorials, and monuments. The course will revisit his work, and, through models and photography, reimagine them as inhabitable spaces.

Over the past decade, the various professions engaged in the construction of the built environment have been investigating (both in theory and practice) a specific and deliberate blurring, hybridization, and expansion of the traditional semantic and historical categories of landscape, architecture, and urbanism in an attempt to confront changing situations, environments, and cultures. Across geographical and cultural boundaries, the proliferation of projects (speculative and built) and essays appearing in recent years makes this phenomenon more than a passing trend or the product of individual reflection. Architecture, for example, as a conventional discipline with its own tasks, internal logic, and modus operandi has become so heterogeneous that it can no longer adequately authenticate its products from within the limits of its historical category. The same holds true of the allied fields of landscape and urbanism. Strict disciplinary boundaries are no longer capable of attending to the complexity of contemporary demands produced by mobility, density, de-urbanization, hybrid programs, changing uses, and ecological concerns. The contemporary world forcibly imposes the need for greater flexibility and indeterminacy and for new techniques of practice that are anticipatory, receptive to change, and capable of opening an aperture to the future. This course will explore these disciplinary slippages and hybrid contacts between until now distinct categories through essays and built or speculative works.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_LAND_401","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Landscape Architecture Design Studio I","catalogNumber":"LANDARCH 5110","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_LAND_401_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Denizen, Seth"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[9,12]}]},"description":"This core studio explores design principles common to architecture and landscape architecture as well as their own specificity. a series of problems will focus onthe relation of component to space through conceptual, analytical, formal, and perceptual investigations.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_LAND_501","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Landscape Architecture Design Studio III","catalogNumber":"LANDARCH 6110","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_LAND_501_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Compadre, L.

This course introduces students to studies of Japanese dwellings by architects such as Bruno Taut, Heino Engel, Kon Wajiro, and Tange Kenzo, familiarizing students with the key texts that sought to define and contest the parameters of vernacular aesthetics in Japanese architecture. Through short readings and weekly discussions, students will learn about the formation of the Japanese House as an idea in the context of Japan's encounter with the West and how this idea influenced modernist design both at home and abroad in complex and sometimes contradictory ways. The workshop component of this seminar focuses on a turning point in Japanese residential design: the 1920s to 1930s, when new ideas about urban life, public hygiene, structural safety, and more reshaped how homes were designed and built in Japan.

Throughout human history, and particularly in the modern period, interior space and its experience has served as both the beginning, the initial inspiration for the design of architecture, as well as the end, the final purpose of architecture as it is evaluated through inhabitation. Since the beginning of the modern period, and continuing today, pivotal discoveries in architectural design may be traced back to a generative ideal of intimate interior experience, and the quality of the interior spatial experience of the inhabitants may be shown to be both the primary determinant of the architectural design process, as well as the means of appropriately evaluating a work of architecture after it is built. This seminar explores how interior space has been integral to the development of modern architecture, and how generations of modern architects have engaged interior space and its experience in their design processes, enabling them to fundamentally transform the traditional methods and goals of architectural composition. For the leading modern architects and for the most recognized and respected architects practicing today, the conception of the interior spatial experience continues to be the necessary starting point for design, and the inhabitation of interior space remains the primary reason to construct works of architecture.   Each class will consist of both faculty lectures based on the chapters of the textbook, The Space Within, and, parallel with the textbook themes, student analyses of selected interior spaces in Florence and Venice, to be visited during the first half of the fall semester. Analytical methods employed in the course cover the full range of contextual, cultural, material, constructive, and experiential attributes of buildings, with particular emphasis on the manner in which the spaces of a building are ordered by the patterns of occupation and the poetics of use, as well as the poetics of construction, or the way in which a building is built, and of what materials it is made, and how all these combine to construct the experience of those who inhabit it.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_601","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Theories & Methods of Historical Research","catalogNumber":"ARCH 6901","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202505_ARCH_601_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Fall","instructor":["Mumford, Eric Paul"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[780,950],"seats":[4,12]}]},"description":"What is architectural history?

With this in mind, you are invited to explore opportunities towards a common ground via the creation of a game.  The debate on urban commons and commoning has grown exponentially in the twenty-first century. We are confronted with a significant amount of literature on commons, commoning, and the common, while the contemporary urban world is dominated by socio-economic disparities, privatization, inadequate resource distribution, and excessive resource extraction. As these forces and challenges unfold, the urge of urban inhabitants to collectively come together is on the rise. We generally see commoning as a base for collaboration and solidarity. Commoning, however, is a complex process as it relates to sharing knowledge and resources, and with regard to conflict and power struggles. Commoning in this context is an act of collective self-regulation and of self-awareness, as the sharing of resources, knowledge, and power create constantly changing rules for commoning and Commoners alike. As the philosopher Jacques Rancière reminds us, flourishing processes of commoning need both narrators and translators. Together, they enable commoning; they help facilitate the connection between people to enable new spatial configurations and stories to unfold. This course organized through two main principal agendas that are intertwined with one another -(re)search analysis and the development of a game revolving around the idea of commoning.
