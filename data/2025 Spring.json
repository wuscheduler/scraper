However, this rich cultural heritage has, historically, largely been approached, studied, and curated according to Western academic, museological, and cultural heritage management approaches. These have often been disconnected from the lived realities of Africans across the continent. Critics of these interconnected hegemonic paradigms and practices have argued that the needs, interests, aspirations, aesthetic philosophies, and concepts of preservation and patrimony of local communities have long been neglected, overlooked, and even undermined by colonially derived and often ethnocentric approaches and understandings of material culture, as well as the expropriation of much of Africa's historic art, much of it now held in Western museum and private collections. These criticisms highlight Africa's ongoing struggle for its art and heritage: to repatriate it, curate it, and represent it in ways more in accordance with various African philosophies and practices.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_3254","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"African Americans and Children's Literature","catalogNumber":"AFAS 3254","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AFAS_3254_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Early, Gerald Lyn"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[7,25]}]},"description":"This course explores two distinct themes: how African descended people have been depicted in American and British children's literature and how African Americans have established a tradition in writing for children and young adults.

Understanding the intersection of law and Black life is increasingly vital in today's socio-political climate. This course highlights the urgent need to examine how Black life is shaped and constrained by legal frameworks and policies that not only reinforce systemic racism but that give rise to Black resistance, social movements, and political strategies. It provides historical context to understand how systemic racism's legacy affects Black communities today, empowers students to advocate for equitable reforms, and fosters informed citizenship by enhancing understanding of legal processes.

From the earliest settled towns of the ancient world in Tichitt (in present-day Mali and Mauretania) and the Nile Valley, to the bustling Medieval metropolises of Ilé-Ifè (Nigeria), Great Zimbabwe, and the Swahili coast (East Africa), the continent witnessed a range of trajectories and outcomes of urban development, leading to diverse forms of hierarchy, heterarchy, social organization, technologies, and arts often very distinctive from those of Europe and the Islamic world beyond Africa. Given that much of the continent did not use written documentary sources until relatively recently, approaches and methods from the disciplines of archaeology and art history are among the best tools to investigate and understand its deep-rooted and sophisticated urban past, and the fundamental contributions of this to the modern world. This class explores the origins, development, and florescence of forms of urbanism and statehood across the African continent, focusing on the complex social structures and dynamics that emerged from, and shaped, these processes, as well as the rich archaeological and artistic record that they stimulated. It will begin by moving chronologically through this long history, and later branch into largely coeval regional examples. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the archaeology and arts of critical urbanized polities such as the early Sahelian metropolis of Djenne-Jeno (Mali), the empires of Dahomey, Oyo, Benin (West Africa), and the kingdom of Kongo (Central Africa) among others.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AFAS_400","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American

The workshop is a response to students' feedback: Graduating seniors tell us they would have liked more structured time to reflect on their work in the major; they would have liked to document their progress and growth in the program more fully; and they wanted more opportunities to strengthen their class cohort. The Senior Workshop will foster all of these things, while centering students' attention on the connections among their academic, personal, and career interests.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_4501","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"American Drama","catalogNumber":"AMCS 4501","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_4501_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schvey, Henry I.","Bonfiglio, William"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,12]}]},"description":"Topics in American Drama.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_326","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"American Economic History","catalogNumber":"AMCS 326","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_326_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Kim, Sukkoo"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,35]}]},"description":"Basic theoretical concepts applied to analyze the changing structure and performance of the American economy from colonial times to the present.

It will examine how and why religious groups have mobilized within the legal arena at various points in US history, the devotional commitments that influence their activism, the constitutional claims and counterclaims that have emerged over time as a result of legal contestation, and the lived impact of various judicial decisions. To do so, the course will be structured thematically around three overlapping constitutional domains: (1) equal protection rights for women and sexual minorities, (2) substantive due process commitments to privacy and bodily autonomy, and (3) free speech principles related to sexual self-expression. The impact of religious advocacy on contemporary controversies such as drag show bans, restrictions on reproductive healthcare, religious exemptions to LGBT non-discrimination laws, pornography regulation, gender-affirming care access, and more will all be covered.  By applying the theories and methods of critical religious studies, this course also takes questions of American religion and sexual politics as a starting point for introducing undergraduate students to legal studies more generally. Through classroom conversations and course texts, students will become familiar with the structure of the American legal system, different methods of constitutional interpretation, theoretical concerns that shape legal thinking, and critical reading skills that may be used to approach legal texts such as judicial opinions. Students from all academic backgrounds interested in gaining increased literacy in American law are encouraged to enroll-no prior exposure is required.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_380R","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"American Religion, Media, and Technology","catalogNumber":"AMCS 380R","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_380R_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Baysa, Michael I."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"American religious communities have often been cast as technological laggards, whether willfully ignorant or generally backwards. Such narratives, fueled by stories about religious leaders condemning cultural trends conceal the ways religions have in fact innovated in the media sphere. Ranging from the time of the earliest printing presses to contemporary social media platforms, this course reframes the question of American religions and media technologies by asking the following questions: How have media technologies shaped religious practice, identity, and belonging? Were religious critiques of mass media valid, particularly around questions of access, constraints, and consumption? And how have religious groups experimented with communications technologies to reimagine their use, message, and audience? These moments of technological encounter reveal how religious communities have not only worked with media technologies, but have driven much of what makes these technologies innovative and modern.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_110A","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Ampersand: American Stories: St. Louis, Power, and the Making of an American City","catalogNumber":"AMCS 110A","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_110A_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Eikmann, Elizabeth Anne"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[0,21]}]},"description":"A scholar of St. Louis history once claimed, \"St. Louis will seem to have been located in entirely different parts of the country throughout its history.\" In many ways, it's a city that defies easy characterization.

This course will explore the history of St. Louis as a place of many places, reading the city's neighborhoods from the nineteenth century to today. Tracing a legacy of neighborhood fragmentation, students will investigate St. Louis as a city of strong, tight knit communities and grassroots organizations with a rich sense of place, but also as a city of fragmentation and barriers.

The historic depth, variety of cultural expression, and circumstances of the collection, exhibition and interpretation of native arts continue to demand our careful and critical attention. We are well situated in St Louis to consider both the indigenous artistic cultures of our own region, and to observe the vitality of native modern and contemporary art practice. Key concerns include the artists' relationship to space and place, their presentation of identities, politicized and activist dimensions of their practices, their negotiation of issues of race and gender, and their conscious relationships to both historic traditions and to contemporary culture. Through the study of local collections and special exhibitions on view in 2023, we will examine a significant range of works-from the Mississippian cultures exemplified by the nearby sites of Cahokia and Sugar Loaf Mound, to the collection of historic materials we will study at the Kemper Art Museum, to the modern and postmodern works on view locally by such artists as Fritz Scholder, Edgar Heap of Birds, Juane Quick-to-See Smith, Faye HeavyShield, Wendy Red Star, Rose Simpson, and others.

We will re-visit history with the analytic tools provided by the concepts of compulsory endogamy, surplus woman, and brahmanical patriarchy, and we will build an understanding of the enduring yet invisible sexual-caste complex. As we will see, caste has always relied on sexual difference, its ever-mutating power enabled by the intersectionalities of race, gender and class. We'll learn how caste adapts to every twist in world history, increasingly taking root outside India and South Asia. We will delve into film and memoir, sources that document the incessant injustices of caste and how they have compounded under globalization. The class will research the exchange of concepts between anti-race and anti-caste activists: how caste has shaped the work of prominent anti-racist intellectuals and activists in the United States such as W.E.B.

The purpose of this course is to explore the following processes: (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions translate into specific school programs and practices; (3) how specific programs and practices influence pedagogies, especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge pedagogies; (4) how these pedagogies impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities reinforce ideologies and power dynamics. This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education. In addition, as this course considers the relationship between politics and power, we explore how politics can manifest itself in ways that promote exclusion and subjugation or work toward the common good. Finally, after carefully examining the research on inequalities and inefficiencies resulting from the current politics of education, we will transition from problem identification (i.e., What went wrong?) to problem solution (i.e., Where do we go from here?).

Dada's emergence in Zürich and New York in the midst of World War I set the tone for its stress on irrationality as an oppositional strategy.

It relies on anime visuals, scratchy jazz samples, and repetitive drum loops. It serves primarily as background music.   This course is about the sounds and popularity of lofi hip hop in the twenty-first century. But to understand this genre, students will also focus on the genre's roots. We learn about French composers' early attempts to create background music at the turn of the twentieth century. We learn about American teenagers who took over their suburban garages to create an energetic style of rock and roll during the 1960s. We learn about how anthropologists during the 1930s thought that low fidelity recordings of blues and country musicians was evidence of their musical authenticity. And we will learn about how jazz harmonies and samples influenced the music of groups like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. Lofi gives us a jumping off point for exploring a wide range of genres and histories.    The final assignment will be a collaborative effort. As a class, students will make and publish a podcast about lofi hip hop and its antecedents. This podcast will feature original lofi hip hop made by the class.

In this course, we will consider texts that would eventually come to be part of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and the Qu'ran as well as several of the exegetes and reading communities that shaped their various interpretations.   We will explore how non-canonical sources played a role in the formation of the various canons we have today, comparing the authoritative status given to these texts to that given to other works from antiquity, such as the epics of Homer.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality.  In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence.

His work reflects the emergent concerns of citizen surveillance in Western democracies and the techno-logics of 21st-century political reality, where persistent monitoring, invisible identification, and data collection are features of both government control and data-driven capitalism. The rise in technological sophistication in both the capture and assessment of data makes adoption at scale by city governments affordable and relatively noncontroversial. But as the surveillance of bodies, habits, associations, and identities becomes more naturalized in the governing and policing institutions of urban areas, legal safeguards lag behind, concepts like privacy and security become fuzzier, and existing inequalities of race and class become hardcoded in the techno-systems supposedly designed as neutral tools. This fieldwork class will explore St. Louis as a landscape of the always observed, from community-level realities to online experiences. Readings and class discussions will be complemented by field trips to sites in the St. Louis region to interrogate the practice of observation in situ among different zip codes and communities where the blanketing presence of surveillance practices and surveillance technology warps a relationship to place; amplifies racial, cultural, and class inequalities and disenfranchisements; consolidates social and political control; and replaces human accountability with the veneer of the objective and rational machine.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_301C","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"The American School","catalogNumber":"AMCS 301C","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_301C_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schultz, Lyndsie Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[6,29]},{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_301C_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Grice, April"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[9,29]},{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_301C_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Kamimura, Aurora del Carmen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[990,1160],"seats":[3,29]}]},"description":"In this course we analyze the development of American schooling within the context of American social history.

Beginning with the earliest human occupations in the region more than 12,000 years ago, this course examines how domestication, urbanization, the rise of early states, and major technological inventions changed life in the Andes from small village societies to the largest territorial polity of the Americas - the Inca Empire.

Together, we will examine archaeological evidence (architecture, art, ceramics, metals, textiles, plant and animal remains, etc.) from context of everyday life (households, food production, craft production) to the rituals and ceremonies (offerings, tombs) that took place in domestic and public spaces.

Students will explore the vibrant intellectual, political, and cultural productions of trans people. The primary geographic focus for the course is the United States, but we will situate U.S. trans studies within broader conversations about gender variance transnationally. While attention will be paid to understanding how transphobia operates, the course emphasizes thinking through the possibilities afforded by trans histories of resistance and refusal.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_297","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Undergraduate Internship in American Culture Studies","catalogNumber":"AMCS 297","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AMCS_297_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Skinner, Karen Elizabeth Smyth"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"Students receive credit for a faculty-directed and approved internship.

Through films available in platforms dedicated to global cinema-Criterion Channel and MUBI more prominently, as well as Netflix, AMC+ and others-, the class will discuss the following: how are diverse cinema traditions from around the world flattened under concepts of art cinema through the platforms? What kinds of films do platform favor and how that favoring affects the styles of cinema worldwide? How have platforms contributed to increase the diversity in the number of countries able to distribute their cinema at a global scale?

The course will use the latest version of ESRI ArcGIS. The course is taught using a combination of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on, interactive tutorials in the classroom. You will also explore the scientific literature to understand how GIS is being used by various disciplines to address spatial questions. The course takes a multidisciplinary approach that is focused on learning the tools of GIS versus working with data from a particular field. The goal is to establish a solid foundation you can use to address spatial questions that interest you, your mentor, or your employee. The first weeks of the course will provide a broad view of how you can display and query spatial data and produce map products. The remainder of the course will explore the power of GIS with a focus on applying spatial analytical tools to address questions and solve problems. As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_5520","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Applied Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 5520","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ANTHRO_5520_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Ampadu, Felix"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[1,20]}]},"description":"This course explores the field of applied anthropology and its approach to understanding human social problems. The focus is on the qualitative and quantitative information applied anthropologists use to study practical human social problems. We will examine the four important factors that influence the practical application of theories and methods to social problems: (1) the specific challenges faced by individuals with particular social identities; (2) the coping strategies developed by local groups and the sustainability of their efforts; (3) the interests and objectives of key actors involved; and (4) the goals, identities, and ethics of researchers. Taking a comparative perspective, the course employs an ethnographic, historical, and geographic approach to understand local problems within global contexts.

We will take a deep dive into the archaeological record of the city and its surroundings, beginning from the earliest human occupation of the land that is now St. Louis all the way up to the present. We will consult a range of archaeological, historical, and artistic sources to uncover the city's past, extending from the lifeways of St. Louis' original Indigenous inhabitants to its time as the capital of Upper Louisiana, to its role as the administrative center of Westward expansion during early American Republic, to its hey-day as one of the United States' largest and wealthiest industrial cities, before its subsequent decline and renewal. The course will examine archaeological sites, artifacts, maps, and documents that contribute to our understanding of the city's past and how its history resonates in the present.  This course is primarily a reading- and discussion-focused course, with occasional lectures, guest speakers, museum visits, and fieldtrips to local archaeological and historical sites.

This course will draw on materials from different disciplines, including anthropology, public health, psychiatry, social work, long form journalism, and guest speakers to examine topics in global mental health, such gender and sexuality, migration and displacement, environmental determinants and climate change, and global crises like COVID-19. Our course materials will draw on research carried out in a variety of locations, including the United States, India, Iran, Italy, Botswana, Brazil, and Thailand.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_3310","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Health, Healing and Ethics: Introduction to Medical Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 3310","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ANTHRO_3310_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Canna, Maddalena"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[73,90]}]},"description":"A cross-cultural exploration of cultures and social organizations of medical systems, the global exportation of biomedicine, and ethical dilemmas associated with medical technologies and global disparities in health.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_5310","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Health, Healing and Ethics: Introduction to Medical Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 5310","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ANTHRO_5310_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Canna, Maddalena"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,90]}]},"description":"This course will offer a broad examination of health, healing and ethics in cross-cultural perspective.

It now seems likely that there are many different pathways to domestication.  In Africa, there is a record of up to several million years of human existence as hunter-gatherers before some human populations adopted food production. Domestication of plants and animals about 10,000 years ago resulted in fundamental changes in human societies.  It provided the basis for the increase in settlement densities, specialization and social stratification, and general decrease in mobility and dietary diversity, characteristic of non-hunter-gatherer societies in the modern world.  In this seminar, the class will explore the phenomenon of domestication, and the spread of food production, surveying the evidence for manipulation and domestication of plant and animal species by prehistoric peoples in Africa.  We will focus on how and why domestication occurred, and factors that influenced its spread, and interactions between late hunter-gatherers and early pastoralists, and intersections with complex societies of the Nile.

These have often been disconnected from the lived realities of Africans across the continent. Critics of these interconnected hegemonic paradigms and practices have argued that the needs, interests, aspirations, aesthetic philosophies, and concepts of preservation and patrimony of local communities have long been neglected, overlooked, and even undermined by colonially derived and often ethnocentric approaches and understandings of material culture, as well as the expropriation of much of Africa's historic art, much of it now held in Western museum and private collections. These criticisms highlight Africa's ongoing struggle for its art and heritage: to repatriate it, curate it, and represent it in ways more in accordance with various African philosophies and practices.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARTARCH_5292","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Art History and Archaeology","title":"Art and Death in Ancient Rome","catalogNumber":"ARTARCH 5292","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARTARCH_5292_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Jones, Nathaniel Barrett"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[2,18]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARTARCH_429","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Art History and Archaeology","title":"Art and Death in Ancient Rome","catalogNumber":"ARTARCH 429","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARTARCH_429_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Jones, Nathaniel Barrett"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[9,18]}]},"description":"Perhaps more than any other phenomenon, death spurred the creation of art in the ancient Roman world. The practice of materially commemorating the deceased -- of perpetuating the memory of the dead through the creation of funerary monuments designed to appeal to both intimate familial relations and the public at large -- stretched across Roman social boundaries and endured for many centuries. But death also frequently provided the subject matter of art even outside the confines of the funerary realm. The goal of this course will be to explore the complex relationship between art and death in the Roman world. It will range from early Rome to the end of the empire and the changes brought about by widespread conversion to Christianity. In conjunction with historical readings, the course will also engage with theoretical texts in the anthropology and philosophy of death.

The historic depth, variety of cultural expression, and circumstances of the collection, exhibition and interpretation of native arts continue to demand our careful and critical attention. We are well situated in St Louis to consider both the indigenous artistic cultures of our own region, and to observe the vitality of native modern and contemporary art practice. Key concerns include the artists' relationship to space and place, their presentation of identities, politicized and activist dimensions of their practices, their negotiation of issues of race and gender, and their conscious relationships to both historic traditions and to contemporary culture. Through the study of local collections and special exhibitions on view in 2023, we will examine a significant range of works-from the Mississippian cultures exemplified by the nearby sites of Cahokia and Sugar Loaf Mound, to the collection of historic materials we will study at the Kemper Art Museum, to the modern and postmodern works on view locally by such artists as Fritz Scholder, Edgar Heap of Birds, Juane Quick-to-See Smith, Faye HeavyShield, Wendy Red Star, Rose Simpson, and others. Class field trips to Cahokia, to the CounterPublic Triennial in St. Louis, and on a spring weekend to Washington DC to visit the National Museum of the American Indian are funded by a generous grant from the Mark S.

He was active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily between ~1592 and 1610.  But who was Caravaggio?  What do we really know about his tempestuous life, and how it factors in the art he created?  Caravaggio was a powerful, brilliant, brutish, and hugely influential artist; a belligerent personality, brawler, and murderer.  He was a man of contradictions:  a devout Christian and bi-sexual sodomite; a Knight of Malta and a fugitive from the law.  This seminar explores the reality and fiction of this fascinating and influential genius, and places him in his historical, social and artistic contexts -- from Baroque Italy to the modern imagination.

From the earliest settled towns of the ancient world in Tichitt (in present-day Mali and Mauretania) and the Nile Valley, to the bustling Medieval metropolises of Ilé-Ifè (Nigeria), Great Zimbabwe, and the Swahili coast (East Africa), the continent witnessed a range of trajectories and outcomes of urban development, leading to diverse forms of hierarchy, heterarchy, social organization, technologies, and arts often very distinctive from those of Europe and the Islamic world beyond Africa. Given that much of the continent did not use written documentary sources until relatively recently, approaches and methods from the disciplines of archaeology and art history are among the best tools to investigate and understand its deep-rooted and sophisticated urban past, and the fundamental contributions of this to the modern world. This class explores the origins, development, and florescence of forms of urbanism and statehood across the African continent, focusing on the complex social structures and dynamics that emerged from, and shaped, these processes, as well as the rich archaeological and artistic record that they stimulated. It will begin by moving chronologically through this long history, and later branch into largely coeval regional examples. Students will have the opportunity to learn about the archaeology and arts of critical urbanized polities such as the early Sahelian metropolis of Djenne-Jeno (Mali), the empires of Dahomey, Oyo, Benin (West Africa), and the kingdom of Kongo (Central Africa) among others.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARTARCH_5741","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Art History and Archaeology","title":"From Ancient Tichitt to Zimbabwe: The Archaeology and Arts of the Urban Past in Africa","catalogNumber":"ARTARCH 5741","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARTARCH_5741_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Evans, Tomos"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[0,45]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARTARCH_238","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Art History and Archaeology","title":"Gothic Art: Patronage, Piety, and Power","catalogNumber":"ARTARCH 238","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARTARCH_238_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,45]}]},"description":"In the twelfth century, a new style of art and architecture flourished in Europe.

Although the precise topics covered may vary from one instructor to another, foundational movements and trends to be discussed will typically include the Beaux-Arts style, the Arts and Crafts Movement, Impressionism, Symbolism, Art Nouveau, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Purism, Art Deco, the Bauhaus, the International Style, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism and Post-Modernism. Cross-currents in various media will be emphasized as we seek to understand the origins and complexity of modern visual forms in relation to political and cultural history and to critical theory.

This seemingly simple question holds a number of complicated, contradictory answers. Latinx art is art created by (and often for) Latinx communities in the United States, but who determines the scope of representation? Is Jean-Michel Basquiat, the famed Haitian-Puerto Rican-American of 1980s NYC, a Latino artist? How about the Cuban-born Ana Mendieta, who lived and worked primarily in the United States? This course will consider who gets counted as Latinx in the art world and why.

At the heart of conceptions of the \"Golden Age\" is the city of Amsterdam, which increased in girth, population, and celebrity between 1600 and 1700. Dutch maritime prowess and trading ventures around the globe resulted in the exponential growth of the urban fabric of Dutch cities and their fame, and Amsterdam was first among equals. Amsterdam was not just the wealthiest, most powerful city in the Dutch Republic, but was praised as the center of the world (omphalos mundi) and celebrated in monuments; and the visual arts were practiced and celebrated widely. But the flow of currency and luxury goods was not the only structuring dynamic: the Dutch involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and the gap between rich and poor, powerful and disenfranchised in the burgeoning metropolis are also hallmarks of the time and place. Studying contemporary scholarly and curatorial approaches to a past that has been by turns glorified and disavowed, this seminar will enable students to engage directly with changing conceptions of the history of this time and place-by reading current historical accounts and editorial interventions and meeting with proponents of various views of the subject (e.g., scholars who have opined that doing away with the \"Golden Age\" model amounts to throwing the baby out with the bathwater vs. scholars and artists who engage with and propose new lenses for assessing the history of Amsterdam and the Dutch Republic in the context of considerations on political violence and enslavement in particular). The seminar will travel to Amsterdam during spring break 2025, for onsite visits with people, places, and works of art, providing students with the unique opportunity to engage directly with the makings and makers of art history.    Prerequisites: Permission of the instructor.

Morgan at Columbia and R.A. Emerson at Cornell, and led to the expansion of classical genetics up to World War II. The beginnings of biochemical and molecular genetics in the 1920s and 1930s developed rapidly after the war with the double-helix theory of DNA and the rise of molecular genetics. The course ends with examination of the Human Genome Project (Initiative) and the ramifications of genetic biotechnology. Throughout, emphasis is placed not only on the technical and theoretical developments comprising genetics as an epistemic field, but also on the economic, social, political and philosophical interconnections between genetics and society. Agriculture, medicine and the ideology of social control (including such movements as eugenics and Nazi race hygiene) both influenced, and were influenced by genetics, and played an integral part in the construction of the science itself.

What if I told you that the scientific evidence does not matter? Over the last few decades, not better education, nor guilt, nor fear has worked to produce change on important environmental and public health issues. In this class, we will explore how values, beliefs, emotions and identity shape how we receive and process information and make decisions. We will explore themes of moral world view, cognitive linguistics and framing, cognitive dissonance, risk perception, empathy, habit changes, and difficult dialoguing through the case studies of climate change and vaccination.

Some areas to be explored:  1. Can consciousness be addressed like any other biological property in the sense that it has evolved by natural selection and that some elements of it are present in simple model systems, such as the fruit fly?  Can insight be gained studying simple model systems? 2. Where in the brain is consciousness?  What is the pattern of neurological events that occurs during consciousness?  Is brain activity generating consciousness localized or distributed?  Does it involve interacting brain regions?  Does brain activity generating consciousness migrate to different brain regions? 3. How does the dynamic core hypothesis of Edelman relate to these questions?  What can functional brain imaging add to these questions?  Are Gamma waves involved in higher mental activity, and do they promote synchronized firing of neurons from different brain areas?  How does this relate to the binding problem? 4. How does the brain's ability to function as a computer relate to consciousness? In many respects the brain functions as a computer using electrical signals called Action Potentials.  Action potentials in neuronal networks function in an analogous was as DC electrical impulses function in computer circuits.  What is the output of computation in an electrical device?  What are the theoretical limitations regarding what computation can achieve and ask whether electrical activity in the brain also has a fundamentally different purpose in addition to computation. 5.  Is our knowledge of the physical world too primitive and incomplete to understand consciousness?  The brain is an electronic device and consciousness clearly depends on its electrical activity.  Yet, electrical forces are poorly understood, both in the context of classical physics and quantum physics.  Will understanding consciousness have to wait for a unified theory that more accurately describes electrical forces?  Prerequisites: Bio3411 or equivalent.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality.  In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess scholarly research and public discourses on education, as well as their own experiences.

From hygienic campaigns against Mexican immigrants in early-1900s California to the 1991 quarantine of Haitian refugees with HIV at Guantanamo Bay, race and sexuality have proven crucial to how society identifies health and, by extension, determines who is fit to be a citizen. This interdisciplinary course interrogates the intersections of race, sexuality, and medicine, discussing how each domain has been constitutive of the other in the American context. Via feminist and queer theorizing, we will examine the political and economic factors under which diseases, illnesses, and health campaigns have impacted racial and sexual minorities over the last two centuries. An orienting question for the course is the following: How has the state wielded public health as a regulatory site to legitimatize perceived racial differences and to regulate ostensible sexual deviations? Through primary and secondary sources, we will likewise explore the various forms of health activism undertaken by these very same targeted populations. Themes to be addressed will include the medicalization of racial and sexual difference; activism both in and against health institutions; and the roles of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability in contemporary health issues. Case studies include the Tuskegee syphilis experiment; the sterilization of black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American women; the medicalization of homosexuality during the Cold War; and the role of mass incarceration in the diffusion of HIV. At a moment in time when access to health continues to be shaped by categories of social difference, understanding the role of public health in the normalization and subversion of racial and sexual hierarchies in the West is more pertinent than ever.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MEDH_468","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Center for the Humanities","title":"Topics in French Literature: Disability Studies, Before Disability","catalogNumber":"MEDH 468","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_MEDH_468_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Singer, Julie E."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[900,1010],"seats":[0,20]}],"lab":[{"id":"SEC_202502_MEDH_468_A_U","number":"A","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Singer, Julie E."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[900,950],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"How do medieval and Renaissance writers understand the structures and functions of the human body?

After a brief methodological introduction to the field, the course will explore key aspects of the medical humanities in East Asia employing a chronological and thematic approach. From ancient China to the present, we will study and compare practices and discourses dealing with health and illness. Although the care of the body and the elimination of disease are today understood (and pursued) primarily within the domain of biomedicine, a look into the past, both remote and recent, reveals the constant intersection between the contemporary categories of religion and medicine.  The analysis of the practices and ideas of doctors, patients, and laypeople on what causes illness and how healing works will lead us to engage with some of the great traditions of East Asia, in particular what is today known as traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM), and Buddhism; and, in more recent times, with the medical technologies introduced from Europe and North-America. We will read selected primary sources and study important works of secondary literature to understand how these traditions have articulated notions of the body, health, and healing at different times and in different geographical contexts, and how they interacted with, influenced or criticized one another.  This course is not meant as a comprehensive survey on health and medicine in East Asia, but rather as an introduction to selected themes and historical moments; therefore, it assumes some familiarity with the history and cultures of East Asia. There will be, however, mini-lectures and additional readings to provide additional context for those who might need it. All readings are in English, and no knowledge of any East Asian language is required, but graduate students will be encouraged to also work on primary or secondary sources in their areas of expertise.

Chemistry has played a vital role in providing the energy needs of society, and advances in chemistry can help to develop abundant and economically viable energy technologies that do not have adverse consequences on the environment. Chemistry has long been central to the use of fossil fuel, and there remain opportunities to improve the efficiency of fossil energy resources, thereby contributing to lower carbon dioxide emission per unit of energy generated. Chemistry is critical to the development of renewable energy resources, especially solar energy for the generation of electricity and fuels. Material covered will include the challenges associated with meeting the world's increasing energy needs while reducing the emission of carbon dioxide.

This is a terrific way to gain exposure about how to prepare your own academic pathway through many diverse fields, through using chemistry as a platform.  In this first year opportunity seminar style course, we rely on active dialogue in the classroom, through questions and discussion.  You can expect to learn about science communication tools and gain some practice with translating difficult science concepts to a broader audience.

The course begins with an overview of the electronic structure of bulk semiconductors. The theoretical and experimental bases for quantum-confinement effects, which are of considerable fundamental and applied interest, will then be developed. A significant emphasis will be placed on the optical absorption and photoluminescence properties of semiconductor quantum nanostructures. Recent advances and observations as reported in the literature will be emphasized throughout the semester.

Storming the villa was just one example of a quest Germans had been undertaking since the Renaissance: to find German national identity with the help of Ancient Greece and Rome. Graeco-Roman antiquity provided the Germans with the first comprehensive description of their ancient ancestors in the Germania and their first national hero, Arminius. In this course, we will study the impact of that Greece and Rome had on German national identity starting in the 16th century when a group of poet-scholars transformed the Germania and Arminius into central components of German national identity. We will trace it through the Enlightenment in the 17th-18th centuries and into the age of imperialism in the 19th century when the first monument to Arminius was erected in Germany, the so-called Hermannsdenkmal (Monument to Arminius). We will end with how the Nazis reinterpreted the culture of Ancient Greece and Rome as a justification for fascism and violent nationalism. We will debate extensively and write in detail about questions of authority, identity, tolerance, intolerance, belonging, and ultimately why classical culture has been one of the most influential forces of the last 500 years. Our focus will lie on three key questions, each of incomparable relevance in today's world: 1. Why did German nationalists turn to Ancient Greece and Rome? Addressing this question willhelp us understand the decisive role classical antiquity has had since Rome fell in 476 CE 2. What specific mechanisms were used to interpret Graeco-Roman culture and knowledge? Answering this will allow us to evaluate how history is always in service of identity and power. 3. How did German identity develop? Evaluating this will help us understand how Renaissance-era poet-scholars were at the beginning of an identity creation that exploded in the 1900s. Our goals are to understand classical culture's potential for use and abuse, and to develop tools for historical thought and insight that help us understand the past and present.

Tracing a legacy of neighborhood fragmentation, students will investigate St. Louis as a city of strong, tight knit communities and grassroots organizations with a rich sense of place, but also as a city of fragmentation and barriers. Discovering what makes St. Louis a uniquely American city, the course will take interdisciplinary approaches to reading compelling primary source documents and will forge connections between St. Louis and other American cities of the past and St. Louis in the present. Students will also take several off-campus trips and engage with local guest speakers from artists to public historians to archivists. definitive definitions or answers, we carefully and thoughtfully examine case studies of American culture and the arts -- literature, theatre, film and painting -- as the lens for understanding images of nation and identity.

These are the questions that a course combining business and literature can address in unique ways; the world of fiction helps us to examine the ethical dilemmas of the market we inhabit every day. In this course, we use great books, classics of film and modern television, and the tools of modern psychology and business strategy to think critically about what is entailed in living a moral life in the midst of the modern market. This course is for first-year (non-transfer) students only.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_GEST_246","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Office","title":"Career Education for Chancellor's Fellows","catalogNumber":"GEST 246","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_GEST_246_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Gahrs, Tyler J.","Sims, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[840,890],"seats":[20,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_GEST_246_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Gahrs, Tyler J.","Sims, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[900,950],"seats":[14,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_GEST_246_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Gahrs, Tyler J.","Sims, Sarah"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[960,1010],"seats":[25,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_GEST_246_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Hung, Ryan Vinh"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[900,950],"seats":[0,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_GEST_246_05_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Hung, Ryan Vinh"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[960,1010],"seats":[0,25]}]},"description":"This course supports students in the Chancellor's Career Fellows Program as they explore their professional interests, navigate their career development process, and identify summer 2023 experiences.

First imagined as an anti-majoritarian and anti-imperial idea, the nation came to be  split between East and West Pakistan, with a hostile Indian nation dividing the country. The subsequent emergence of Bangladesh, from within, exposed the complexities of US imperial and Indian power, colonialism, identity, ethnicity, race, nationalism and repression. More recently, the War on Terror has once again exploited the ethnic and cultural conflicts produced by world histories of power and resistance.  The events of the past two hundred years have undoubtedly and violently exacerbated the politicization of social and cultural identities. This course situates Pakistan in the context of pre-colonial social formations, British colonialism, internal colonialism, US imperialism, the Cold War, Soviet interests, Indian regional hegemony and then turns to the powerful and diverse struggles launched by its own citizens against these external forces. How did successive empires construct and politicize social identities, and how did people contest and adapt these? How did caste, gender, race and religion shape empire and anti-imperial histories?  Our sources will be historical, ethnographic, and literary. We will cover topics such as colonial fantasies, decolonization, the political uses of social categories of tribe, caste, language and gender, the political economy of militarism, terrorism, 'development', activism, diasporic formations, poetry, music and art.

The works studied will be Virgil's and Ovid's versions of the Orpheus myth set to music by Claudio Monteverdi in 1607 as one of the earliest operas.

Less than six months after the launch of OpenAl's ChatGPT, Goldman Sachs reported that generative Al could replace 300 million jobs and a quarter of work tasks in the ones that remain. Those figures are probably overblown, but Al has already started changing professions across the entire economy-sometimes in earnest ways, and others through the consequences of Al hype.  Where does this leave you, as a student who might hope to enter the workforce in the next one to four years? This one-credit, pass/fail course offers an overview of how actual professions are contending  with Al. Each week, a guest from an industry in which WashU graduates have historically pursued careers (derived from data collected by the university's Center for Career Engagement) will join the class to discuss what's happening now in their profession, and what they see on the horizon.  Some of you may know (or think you know) exactly what job you want-doctor, lawyer, financier, software engineer, whatever . Students change their minds, but they also end up in different jobs than they expect. No matter what career you choose, you will also find yourself working with professionals across sectors. For that reason, students will benefit from a broad view of the whole Al economy, not just the narrow part of it you currently think applies to your career goals.  In addition to learning from professionals on the ground, students will also take an active role in imagining the Al future of a career, through a future forecasting method called design fiction. Design fiction involves creating a designed object (such as a quick-start guide, a menu, a mailing, an advertisement, a how-to video-or really anything!) that imagines how it might feel to live in a world that works differently from our own.

These decisions affect our environment, public health, state infrastructure, and government at every level. Identifying trustworthy academic research and journalism while resisting misguided public opinion and malicious disinformation campaigns can be daunting, particularly when we reflect on our own vulnerability to cognitive biases. Citizen Scientist aims to develop the ability to distinguish meaningful expertise from self-interested distortions and status quo platitudes. At the intersection of civic responsibility and academic research, Citizen Scientist introduces students to college writing as well-researched writing. The course will teach students to analyze and generate scholarly arguments as they deepen their understanding of the dynamic interaction between opinion, policy, activism, journalism, and the research university.

Most importantly, students will have the opportunity to write original works synthesizing and offering new views on what it means to live here in this world, to have a place in an ecosystem or a city, a house or a hospital. We'll study our local community, from perspectives in our classroom to the wider conversations across the St. Louis region as we discover and write about our surroundings. We'll foreground diversity in both in our class conversations and the writers we'll read, from issues of inequality to concerns of access and the responsibilities of citizens. The class will feature multidisciplinary perspectives in conversations with our faculty as they reflect on their experiences writing within and about places.

How might our taste in film relate to our taste in sneakers? How does writing itself contribute to larger media discourse? This course will explore how our choices as consumers, creators, and writers are mediated by broader cultural forces such as film, foodways, music, television, art, and social media. Commodity culture refers to what aspects of culture can be evaluated in terms of supposed worth or economic value. Here students will think critically, draft, take risks, and revise to present work that has been elevated to college-level writing and argumentation. Readings will explore a range of cultural texts and topics -- whether it's the popularity of Grey Poupon in hip hop or racial tension in the St. Louis restaurant scene, the role of smartphones and social media in the rise of self-branding, or the blurred line between high art and Instagram. As avid readers and writers, we will delve into the details of rhetorical context to approach both published media and our own essays as instances of cultural production. No prior knowledge of foodways, art history, or media studies is necessary for this course, but students should arrive hungry, with an appetite for a nuanced appreciation of how something as seemingly innocuous as cultural output intersects with larger structures of status and power.

Our course's theme -- technology -- is the subject matter that we will be reading to hone skills such as analysis, argumentation, and critical thinking. This does not mean that a student must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform a student into one. Rather, this course treats technology in its broadest sense, from its root in the Greek techne (which means craftsmanship, craft, art, or rhetoric) to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology, we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays, we will address responsible uses of technology and the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and we will try to answer questions like the following: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? What roles do we want it to play in our future?

And yet hoaxes have been around longer than the internet, and often do work beyond the realm of the political.  Kevin Young writes in Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbugs, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts and Fake News that the hoax is suited to America in a way that other places can only aspire to, with our fake-it-til-you-make-it hucksterism a kind of national ethos. In this course we look at a wealth of hoaxes, from those in art, which are often designed to shake our faith in institutions telling us what is valuable and to ask us to think for ourselves, to those of the newspaper wars of the 1800s, when outrageous scoops about the creatures who live on the moon helped sell papers to readers who were invited to enjoy, if not quite believe, the news.  We will examine what we can learn from these historical and contemporary apolitical hoaxes, and how that knowledge can be brought to bear on those we see today, where hoaxes can fray trust in public institutions like the press, the government, and even the university.

Students will rely on analytical and research skills, with an emphasis on the idea that all writing is creative and can enact a meaningful paradigm shift, even if the subject is as seemingly innocuous as food.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CWP_201","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Writing Program","title":"Writing Workshop","catalogNumber":"CWP 201","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_CWP_201_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Thu"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[16,15]}]},"description":"This workshop focuses on engaging research, with all of the multiple meanings implied in the phrase's wordplay: engaging as interesting and interested; as active, responsive to and engaged with others.  Just what we mean by engaging - and by research, for that matter - will be our topic of conversation all semester, and you should come prepared to contribute your views on that topic and to complicate your current understanding.  Where possible, we will focus on practical, applied work with sources, which should provide a good foundation for advanced research and writing in your discipline, and we'll give some thought to the different methods by which different audiences and scholarly disciplines select, analyze, evaluate, incorporate, and document the works of others.  Along the way, we will attend to the relationship between different kinds of research projects and the types of sources that suit them, and we'll practice techniques for drawing on the ideas and writings of others in responsible and engaged ways.  Finally, we will grapple with the subtleties and complexities of Academic Integrity, attempting to understand not only the principles that govern responsible research but also the assumptions that underlie them.  Ultimately, this course should enhance your ability to produce scholarly writing that not only draws on the voices and views of others responsibly, but that also speaks with its own distinct, engaging voice, that builds its own original arguments.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"da120a5a-44e5-4a5a-a7ca-83017c6f1ec2","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"","title":"","catalogNumber":"","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[]},"description":"","level":""},{"id":"CRS_BIOL_5491","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences","title":"Advanced Genetics","catalogNumber":"BIOL 5491","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_BIOL_5491_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schedl, Tim B","Saccone, Nancy L."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[720,770],"seats":[28,75]}]},"description":"Fundamental aspects of organismal genetics with emphasis on experimental studies that have contributed to the molecular analysis of complex biological problems.

Where do modern people spend almost a third of their life? Their beds! In addition to facilitating sleep and relaxation and its association with marriage and sexuality, the bed also is the centerpiece and likely the most expensive item of furniture item in the bedroom. Across cultures, from medieval Europe to imperial China, beds served as tokens of status that marked families' success and material wealth in increasingly commercialized and stratified societies. In the modern era, beds have drawn scrutiny from sociologists, sexologists, and social critics interested in questions of gender, family, and sexuality. A historical bed might also capture other meanings: its pathways through production, circulation, and consumption might illuminate global trading networks in lumber, labor, and finished commodities. It might reveal (or allow people to imagine) the transmission of craft knowledge, family formation, wealth accumulation (or dissipation), and social mobility. With these possibilities in mind, students will investigate and restore an antique Chinese wedding bed. Work will combine digital tools with humanistic research methods to facilitate a cultural history that engage questions of intimacy, nuptials, curation and conservation, and global trade and cultural exchanges.

If different cultures of making exist, what forms do they take and why? In this course, students will explore these and other questions concerning the central human activity that is the production of material objects. From a Korean rice wine brewer to a Japanese clockmaker and to the Shanzhai cellphone manufacturers, makers in East Asia have distinguished themselves as skillful practitioners throughout history. The aim of this course is to understand their ways of production -- and how these, in turn, evolved alongside broader changes in society and culture. The course begins by appreciating the challenges of studying making cultures and the importance of material, hands-on research, which involves, for instance, cooking with historical recipes. The course then investigates the history of artisanship in relation to social structures and statecraft and the many ways in which it unfolded in Korea, Japan, and China and across various artifacts, from kimchi and porcelain to steam engines and Van Gogh paintings. For the term project, students have the option of reworking a historical recipe or artifact from East Asia before the modern era. During this process, students will learn by doing and explore the tacit knowledge involved in the creation and maintenance of craft practices.

In this course, students will adopt a multidisciplinary approach and explore the history, literature, art and practices of Pure Land Buddhism in China, Korea and Japan. In particular, the course will focus on the relationship between devotionalism, practice and salvation; and on discourses about human nature and their implications in terms of approaches to Buddhism. In other words, what do we do when the world as we know it seems to be ending? Students will read primary sources drawn from a wide range of genres - meditation manuals, letters, canonical scriptures and hagiographic narratives. They will familiarize themselves with the most important figures, deities and texts of the Pure Land traditions in East Asia, and they will study the arts and material culture of Pure Land Buddhism, one of the richest in East Asia.

While the modalities and implications of cultural transmission constitute the overarching theme of this course, some of the specific issues we will examine include: Buddhism and the state; hagiographic literature; bodhisattva cults; relic worship; the interpretation of portents and notions of kingship; universalism and particularism in East Asian Buddhism; Buddhist discourses on violence; the role of Buddhism within colonialism and liberation movements. Basic historiographical and methodological issues will also be discussed, and we will spend some time thinking about the modern implications of the study of premodern Korean Buddhism and history.

There are too many theories, though, and most of them have little to do with anything we have ever observed in human history. Some theories are elegant and parsimonious, even beautiful, but they belong to the science fiction section: they talk about the economic growth that could have possibly happened on some planet, but did not happen on ours. One should learn about their existence, and make a memo to never again walk along those paths to try understanding economic growth on planet Earth. Other theories, e.g. those assuming exogenous growth, are really not theories but useful accounting frameworks from where one should start asking the modeling questions. The course is structured along a history of economic thought line: it begins with the classical economists (Ricardo, Malthus and Marx)  as they had theories about the necessary absence of economic growth in the long run, and it ends with the current theories about increasing returns, widespread externalities and the weightless economy. The approach is fairly rigorous, but it assumes that participants read the original articles/books and go through the proofs themselves. As we go along we try to separate good theories from bad theories and, more important, we try to separate theories from models, the latter being theories that have some qualitative and quantitative consistency with observed facts.  It is models, at the end, that we want to learn about.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ECON_490","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Economics","title":"Independent Work","catalogNumber":"ECON

Methods for structural estimation are increasingly used in several areas of empirical microeconomics. Students interested in all applied areas in microeconomics are encouraged to take this class. Methods will be illustrated with applications drawing from several fields (Labor Economics, Family Economics, Development Economics, Empirical Industrial Organization, Health Economics, Law & Economics, Urban Economics, Empirical Public Economics, Environmental Economics, Economics of Education, etc). and representing the research interests of the audience.  We will cover the estimation of static models, but we will emphasize the use of dynamic structural models. We will cover frontal methods (i.e., methods that involve solving the economic problem inside a estimation routine) as well as the methods that avoid the computational burden associated with a full-solution approach to estimation. We will also go over methods to estimate the parameters of static and dynamic games. There is no final exam. Grades are based on computational problem sets and research paper proposal using methods covered in class.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ECON_499","school":"Arts &

The purpose of this course is to explore the following processes: (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions translate into specific school programs and practices; (3) how specific programs and practices influence pedagogies, especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge pedagogies; (4) how these pedagogies impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities reinforce ideologies and power dynamics. This course considers politics across time, space, and individuals, noting how historical, geographical, cultural, social, psychological, political, and economic contexts can shape the politics of education.

The purpose of this course is to explore the following processes: (1) how ideologies and power dynamics influence educational policies and decisions; (2) how educational policies and decisions translate into specific school programs and practices; (3) how specific programs and practices influence pedagogies, especially in the relationships among students, teachers, and knowledge pedagogies; (4) how these pedagogies impact student opportunities and outcomes; and (5) how student outcomes and opportunities reinforce ideologies and power dynamics.

As such, schools are an institution deserving of rigorous scrutiny and careful interrogation. But in studying K- 12 schools, we are in fact attending to a multitude of things - competing visions of and purposes for schools, and disparate experiences of accessing and navigating education that are widely divergent along axes of inequality. In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence. In so doing, students will develop the capacity to more critically assess scholarly research and public discourses on education, as well as their own experiences.

The movie wasn't faithful to the book. The TV series didn't capture the book like the movie did. These have forever been the complaints of readers watching their favorite works of literature adapted to the screen, and, in a media ecosystem increasingly flooded with adaptations and reboots of existing intellectual property, these complaints won't be going away any time soon. Film and literature have been interconnected since the very first films screened at end of the nineteenth century, but the dynamic between literature and media has sometimes been strained: film reviled as the cheap degradation of a vital art form, the novel anxious at the rise of narrative film - and later television - as rival storytelling media. But, viewing literature and visual media in opposition can obscure what becomes visible if we view them together. This is a course about the history, theory, and practice of adaptation from literature to film and television and back again rooted in both canonical and non-canonical case studies. We will study authors whose works have been repeatedly adapted across eras and media; filmmakers whose works are pastiches of various literary and cinematic sources; rigorously, obsessively faithful adaptations; radically transformative unfaithful adaptations; and works of literature and media that are themselves about the process and ethics of adaptation. The course will be anchored by a reading of Emily St. John Mandel's 2014 novel Station Eleven and a serial viewing - replicating the unusual original release - of HBO Max's miniseries adaptation.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_421","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Advanced Fiction Writing","catalogNumber":"WRITING 421","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WRITING_421_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Klimasewiski, Marshall N"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,14]}]},"description":"For qualified students who wish to continue their creative writing and reading through immersion in an intensive fiction workshop.

Readings will include works of French feminism, Foucault's History of Sexuality, feminist responses to Foucault, queer (LGBTQ+) theory, postcolonial and decolonial feminism, feminist disability theory, and writings by US feminists of color (African-American, Asian-American, Latina, Native-American). The reading list will be updated each year to reflect new developments in the discipline. We will approach these readings from an intersectional and interdisciplinary perspective, considering their dialogue with broader sociopolitical, cultural, and philosophical currents. By the end of the course, students are expected to have gained a basic knowledge of the major debates in feminist literary and cultural studies in the last 50 years, as well as the ability to draw on the repertoire of readings to identify and frame research questions in their areas of specialization. The class will be largely interactive, requiring active participation and collaborative effort on the part of the students. Students will be encouraged to make relevant connections between the class readings, everyday social and political issues, and their own research interests.

The widespread changes and upheavals of the last century have vastly expanded the ranks of such people, accelerating the processes of immigration and exile while fundamentally altering traditional notions of home and belonging. This course will examine fiction by writers such as Jhumpa Lahiri, Albert Camus, Jean Rhys, Franz Kafka, and Teju Cole, who write from and about the position of outsider, exploring what such texts have to say about living in an unsettled, diasporic modern world - a world in which real belonging seems an increasingly elusive goal. In reading these texts, we will investigate how their authors have portrayed the journeys, hopes, and hardships of dislocation and alienation, as well as the role literature might play in creating a sense of community for immigrants, refugees, and people living in various forms of exile.

In this course, we will read Roth's major novels and explore how his fiction addressed these questions. Moreover, we will discuss how we can approach Roth's fiction in the wake of such events as the Trump presidency, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the #Me Too Movement. How do we read Roth in the wake of the political and social traumas that have shaped our recent history? How does Roth's fiction speak to the recent rise in anti-Semitism? To help inform these questions, we will also consider how contemporary writers, such as Nicole Krauss and Taffy Brodesser-Akner, have directly reconsidered Roth's legacy in their fiction, rethinking his treatment on such topics as Jewish-American identity, sexual politics, and the status of the novel.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_298","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Journalism: Communications Internship","catalogNumber":"WRITING 298","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WRITING_298_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["McPherson, Edward R"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"For students undertaking projects in newspaper or magazine journalism, in radio or television, or in business, government, foundations, and the arts.

Within a developing discourse of human rights and personal freedom, this growing assertion through poetry of individual expressivity allowed William Blake to construct in a single work a visual and verbal Jerusalem.  It encouraged William Wordsworth to write a pathbreaking investigation of the sources of his own creativity that challenged conventional restraints on what topics can, and cannot, be confessed in poetry.  Beginning with these two poets, we will consider the historical contexts, and the sometimes competing histories of ideas, that shaped the five major British Romantic poets:  Blake, Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and John Keats.  We will follow an anthology for much of the poetry, including the poems and prose of influential contemporaries (female as well as male) who included the political philosopher Edmund Burke and Mary Wollstonecraft.

The goal is to establish a solid foundation you can use to address spatial questions that interest you, your mentor, or your employee. The first weeks of the course will provide a broad view of how you can display and query spatial data and produce map products. The remainder of the course will explore the power of GIS with a focus on applying spatial analytical tools to address questions and solve problems. As the semester develops, more tools will be added to your GIS toolbox so that you can complete a final independent project that integrates materials learned during the course with those spatial analyses that interest you the most. Students will have the choice of using a prepared final project, a provided data set, or designing an individualized final project using their own or other available data.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_580","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Applications in GIS","catalogNumber":"ENST 580","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_580_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["George, Christian O"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,2]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_580_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["George, Christian O"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[1,2]}]},"description":"This introductory course in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is designed to provide basic knowledge of GIS theory and applications using the existing state-of-the-art GIS software.

These Indigenous practices regularly teach methods of living within the world and can provide significant insight into current practices to manage public and private lands.   This course looks to examine some of those stories, cultural beliefs, and Native American life practices which have shaped the land.

Some leaders believe that the sole purpose of business is to maximize shareholder wealth and that fiscal sustainability is not compatible with environmental responsibility. In reality, ecological and economic performance need not--and should not--be mutually exclusive. Fortunately, the outmoded mindset of profit-at-any-cost is beginning to shift as organizations recognize the importance of adopting balanced business practices that promote social equity and environmental prosperity without sacrificing financial stability. Organizations that embed sustainability into their corporate strategies increase operational efficiency by using resources more responsibly and minimizing waste. In an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace, sustainability has become a source of competitive advantage through which an organization can have a positive impact not only on the financial bottom line but also on the environment and society. In this course, we explore key concepts and issues driving sustainability in business. We also examine core sustainability principles, frameworks, and tools that companies can use to better understand and work within the natural systems that enable their existence and sustain their operations.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_210","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Undergraduate Teaching Assistant","catalogNumber":"ENST 210","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_210_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["VanRiper, Froggi"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_210_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Loui, Suzanne Jeanette"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_210_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_375","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Urban Ecology","catalogNumber":"ENST 375","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_375_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[20,30]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ENST_375_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[19,30]}]},"description":"Urban Ecology is a field of study within ecology that focuses on the urban environment as an ecosystem and attempts to understand how humans and nature can better coexist in these highly modified environments.

The movie wasn't faithful to the book. The TV series didn't capture the book like the movie did. These have forever been the complaints of readers watching their favorite works of literature adapted to the screen, and, in a media ecosystem increasingly flooded with adaptations and reboots of existing intellectual property, these complaints won't be going away any time soon. Film and literature have been interconnected since the very first films screened at end of the nineteenth century, but the dynamic between literature and media has sometimes been strained: film reviled as the cheap degradation of a vital art form, the novel anxious at the rise of narrative film - and later television - as rival storytelling media. But, viewing literature and visual media in opposition can obscure what becomes visible if we view them together. This is a course about the history, theory, and practice of adaptation from literature to film and television and back again rooted in both canonical and non-canonical case studies. We will study authors whose works have been repeatedly adapted across eras and media; filmmakers whose works are pastiches of various literary and cinematic sources; rigorously, obsessively faithful adaptations; radically transformative unfaithful adaptations; and works of literature and media that are themselves about the process and ethics of adaptation. The course will be anchored by a reading of Emily St. John Mandel's 2014 novel Station Eleven and a serial viewing - replicating the unusual original release - of HBO Max's miniseries adaptation.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_FILM_452","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Film and Media Studies","title":"Advanced Screenwriting","catalogNumber":"FILM 452","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_FILM_452_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Chapman, Richard"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[15,20]}]},"description":"This course is intended for students who have already taken Film Studies 352, Introduction to Screenwriting.

Then, we will survey women directors working outside of the system in documentary, independent, and experimental filmmaking modes. Finally, we will adopt a transnational perspective to investigate the contributions of women directors to world cinema, contextualizing the films of women cinéastes from countries such as Hong Kong, Argentina, and Iran in relation to their national cinemas and international film festival networks.

This course will introduce you to the debates and new technologies that are transforming moving image archiving. It mixes readings and discussions of scholarly works and professional white papers with hands-on activities to show how the seemingly apolitical labor of archivists, like cataloging and reference, reflects ideologies of professionalism, gender, class, and race. While introducing you to the current best practices in digitizing media for long-term preservation, it will also ask you to analyze how those professional standards came into being. This class is made possible by WashU Libraries Film & Media Archive's (FMA) collections and legacy technologies, as well as its staff's time and expertise. As such, we will focus on areas of moving image archiving that the FMA specializes in including nontheatrical film, the 16mm film format, social justice documentaries, and Black media production.

To achieve genuine refugee/ Migrant oriented reform policies, the Global North needs to reconcile with its colonial past. Towards this end, we will highlight how the history of Migration is deeply entangled with colonialism.  Our readings-based discussions will focus on analyzing how colonial logics continue to shape the dynamics of migration as well as fuel the growing Xenophobia and Anti-migration rhetoric in the Global North towards intercontinental human mobility.  To understand the enduring legacies of colonialism on the contemporary politics of migration, our discussions will argue the premise that colonial histories should be central to migration studies today for there to be real reform in refugee, asylum, and migrant policies. We will explore a wide range of inspiring and challenging perspectives on migration and learn what postcolonial and decolonial scholarships can offer us studying international migration today. We will address these areas through our weekly readings of Migration Studies and Colonialism as a primary source; we will also survey a selection of articles as a secondary source. To supplement the readings, we will watch short documentaries addressing the topic as well as hear from activists, journalists, and specialists in the field.

As home to the major holy cities of Islam and a key source of global oil, the region has played an important role in the Western European and North American imagination. Despite being relatively sparsely populated, the peninsula hosts millions of believers each year on the annual Muslim pilgrimage, and it has been the site of major wars and military occupations by European, American, and other Middle Eastern countries for much of the 20th and 21st centuries. It has been an outpost of the Ottoman Empire, a center of British colonialism and (at Aden) an axis of its global empire, the location of Egypt's Vietnam (its long war in Yemen in the 1960s), the Gulf Wars I and II, and the recent wars in Yemen, to name just a few of the major conflicts. Often depicted as unchanging until caught up by the influx of massive oil wealth, this region is frequently characterized as a place of contradictions: home to some of the world's largest skyscrapers and also the most inhospitable and largest sand desert in the world, known as the Empty Quarter; the location of crucial American allies and the home of al-Qa'eda founder `Usama Bin Laden. In this course, we will examine the development of the peninsula historically to understand these contradictory images. We will investigate changes in the following arenas: environment and society; colonial occupation; newly independent states; the demise and development of key economic sectors (pearling; shipping; agriculture; oil; finance; piracy); political regimes; resources such as water, oil, and date palms; the growth of oil extraction infrastructure and its effects on the political regimes and societies in the region; the emergence of new Gulf cities; Islamic law; women's rights; human rights debates; and religious and ethnic minorities.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AAS_366","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Global Studies","title":"Caste: Globalization, Sexuality and Race","catalogNumber":"AAS 366","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_AAS_366_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Chandra, Shefali"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,25]}]},"description":"Be it sati or enforced widowhood, arranged or love marriage, the rise of national leaders like Indira Gandhi and Kamala Harris, or the obsession with fair skin, caste shapes possibilities and perceptions for billions.

First imagined as an anti-majoritarian and anti-imperial idea, the nation came to be  split between East and West Pakistan, with a hostile Indian nation dividing the country. The subsequent emergence of Bangladesh, from within, exposed the complexities of US imperial and Indian power, colonialism, identity, ethnicity, race, nationalism and repression. More recently, the War on Terror has once again exploited the ethnic and cultural conflicts produced by world histories of power and resistance.  The events of the past two hundred years have undoubtedly and violently exacerbated the politicization of social and cultural identities. This course situates Pakistan in the context of pre-colonial social formations, British colonialism, internal colonialism, US imperialism, the Cold War, Soviet interests, Indian regional hegemony and then turns to the powerful and diverse struggles launched by its own citizens against these external forces. How did successive empires construct and politicize social identities, and how did people contest and adapt these? How did caste, gender, race and religion shape empire and anti-imperial histories?

Under English rule from the twelfth century Norman invasions to the establishment of the Irish Free State and the partition of Northern Ireland in 1922, Ireland presents a compelling, historical laboratory to deliberate on the relationship between gender and political conflict. Intentionally transdisciplinary, the course draws from across disciplinary discourses and highlights perspectives across race, gender, class, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality. Topics include: political organizing, nationalism, rebellion, radicalization, militarism, terrorism, pacifism, and peacebuilding. Rooted in Cynthia Enloe's enduring question Where are the women? and drawing on sociologist Louise Ryan's landmark essay by the same name, we inquire how and why Irish nationalist women, who were integral to building the revolutionary movement, became Furies and Die-hards in the eyes of their compatriots when the Free State was established (Bishop Doorley, 1925; President Cosgrave, 1923). Taking advantage of the plethora of archival resources now available through the Irish Decade of Centenaries program, the course incorporates the voices of Irish women through their diaries, military records, letters, interviews, speeches, newspapers, and memoirs.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_GS_457","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Global Studies","title":"Gender and Modernity in Latin America","catalogNumber":"GS 457","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_GS_457_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Morana, Mabel E"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[960,1130],"seats":[1,20]}]},"description":"The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the particular forms modernity assumes in Latin American countries and to the ways in which national cultures, identity politics, and gender issues interweave during the 20th-century.

Focusing on reset diplomacy during the terms of five American and three Russian presidents since 1990, it reveals a familiar historical pattern that begins with high hopes, dialogue, and optimism only to be followed by vast disappointment, standoffs, and pessimism. Despite this dynamic, the course shows how and why the two countries have been able to cooperate at times to make substantial headway on critical issues such as arms control, nonproliferation of WMD, NATO expansion, counterterrorism, and economic and energy development, whereas at other times they have run afoul of major obstacles such as further NATO expansion, missile defense, and democracy and human rights in Russia. The course also examines how many political events created substantial challenges to U.S.-Russia relations, including the Balkan Wars; U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; Russia's wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Ukraine/Crimea; the Color Revolutions; the Arab Spring and subsequent civil wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya; the fight against ISIS and other militant Islamists; the threats posed by Iran and North Korea; the rise of China; espionage crises; hybrid wars; cyberattacks; and disinformation campaigns. Two vital questions frame the analysis: (1) Why has it been so difficult for these two great powers to develop a mutually beneficial relationship? (2) What would be required to move beyond the limited partnership to something more productive and sustaining? The course concludes by evaluating reset diplomacy and the ongoing attempts to move U.S.-Russia relations beyond a Hot Peace.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_GS_400","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Global Studies","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"GS 400","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_GS_400_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"Prerequisite:  junior or senior standing.

The course begins by inquiring how sociologists understand racial distinctions, asking: What comprises a racial group? What constitutes a group in the social sense? The course then shifts to explore patterns of racial inequality in the U.S., particularly through investigating the intersections of economic, political, and racial stratification. After analyzing national trends in racial stratification, the course narrows its focus to particular regions and metropolitan areas, including St. Louis, to shed light on pressing public concerns such as the interrelationships between race and the criminal justice system. The course ends by looking beyond U.S. borders to compare the way that race is understood in other countries. Are there common patterns of racial classification shared by many societies? What makes the U.S. system of racial stratification distinctive?

Within a developing discourse of human rights and personal freedom, this growing assertion through poetry of individual expressivity allowed William Blake to construct in a single work a visual and verbal Jerusalem.  It encouraged William Wordsworth to write a pathbreaking investigation of the sources of his own creativity that challenged conventional restraints on what topics can, and cannot, be confessed in poetry.  Beginning with these two poets, we will consider the historical contexts, and the sometimes competing histories of ideas, that shaped the five major British Romantic poets:  Blake, Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, and John Keats.  We will follow an anthology for much of the poetry, including the poems and prose of influential contemporaries (female as well as male) who included the political philosopher Edmund Burke and Mary Wollstonecraft.

It will examine how and why religious groups have mobilized within the legal arena at various points in US history, the devotional commitments that influence their activism, the constitutional claims and counterclaims that have emerged over time as a result of legal contestation, and the lived impact of various judicial decisions. To do so, the course will be structured thematically around three overlapping constitutional domains: (1) equal protection rights for women and sexual minorities, (2) substantive due process commitments to privacy and bodily autonomy, and (3) free speech principles related to sexual self-expression. The impact of religious advocacy on contemporary controversies such as drag show bans, restrictions on reproductive healthcare, religious exemptions to LGBT non-discrimination laws, pornography regulation, gender-affirming care access, and more will all be covered.  By applying the theories and methods of critical religious studies, this course also takes questions of American religion and sexual politics as a starting point for introducing undergraduate students to legal studies more generally. Through classroom conversations and course texts, students will become familiar with the structure of the American legal system, different methods of constitutional interpretation, theoretical concerns that shape legal thinking, and critical reading skills that may be used to approach legal texts such as judicial opinions. Students from all academic backgrounds interested in gaining increased literacy in American law are encouraged to enroll-no prior exposure is required.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_3803","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Ancient Greek and Roman Medicine","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3803","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3803_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Salas, Luis Alejandro"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,650],"seats":[14,85]}],"lab":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3803_A_D","number":"A","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Stephens, Marisa"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Fri"],"time":[600,650],"seats":[2,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3803_B_D","number":"B","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Butovetskiy, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Fri"],"time":[600,650],"seats":[4,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3803_C_D","number":"C","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Van Denburgh, Tom"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Fri"],"time":[600,650],"seats":[4,22]},{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3803_D_D","number":"D","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Wang, Zhiyuan"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Fri"],"time":[600,650],"seats":[4,22]}]},"description":"This course introduces students to the practice and theory of medicine in the ancient Mediterranean, beginning in Egypt and continuing through Greece and Rome.

We will re-visit history with the analytic tools provided by the concepts of compulsory endogamy, surplus woman, and brahmanical patriarchy, and we will build an understanding of the enduring yet invisible sexual-caste complex. As we will see, caste has always relied on sexual difference, its ever-mutating power enabled by the intersectionalities of race, gender and class. We'll learn how caste adapts to every twist in world history, increasingly taking root outside India and South Asia. We will delve into film and memoir, sources that document the incessant injustices of caste and how they have compounded under globalization. The class will research the exchange of concepts between anti-race and anti-caste activists: how caste has shaped the work of prominent anti-racist intellectuals and activists in the United States such as W.E.B.

The course examines a wide range of historical, sociological, and anthropological materials and methods in order to trace the everyday workings of different scientific disciplines within a living laboratory, which are a series of spaces and sites that produce knowledge. These also happen to be spaces that are conventionally not viewed as normative scientific spaces, but spaces where cross-cultural contact produced knowledge (i.e., early modern philosophical, brokered and subaltern, cartographic, mechanical, astral, environmental knowledge). We will trace the uneven and indetermined progression of this knowledge across the Global South to understand how these ideas were made, circulated, resisted, and changed over time not just in Europe, but in Africa, East Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia. Given the interconnected nature of world history, students will also acquire tools to understand themes such as colonization, modernization, democracy, and social change critically engaged with categories of race, gender, and class.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_2158","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"First Year Seminar: Outcasts and Outlaws: The History of Othering in Modern Europe","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 2158","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_2158_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schult, Anne"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[12,19]}]},"description":"Villainous figures such as pirates, bandits, rebels, and terrorists have easily jumped from the historical record into the broader cultural imaginary.

First imagined as an anti-majoritarian and anti-imperial idea, the nation came to be  split between East and West Pakistan, with a hostile Indian nation dividing the country. The subsequent emergence of Bangladesh, from within, exposed the complexities of US imperial and Indian power, colonialism, identity, ethnicity, race, nationalism and repression. More recently, the War on Terror has once again exploited the ethnic and cultural conflicts produced by world histories of power and resistance.  The events of the past two hundred years have undoubtedly and violently exacerbated the politicization of social and cultural identities. This course situates Pakistan in the context of pre-colonial social formations, British colonialism, internal colonialism, US imperialism, the Cold War, Soviet interests, Indian regional hegemony and then turns to the powerful and diverse struggles launched by its own citizens against these external forces. How did successive empires construct and politicize social identities, and how did people contest and adapt these? How did caste, gender, race and religion shape empire and anti-imperial histories?  Our sources will be historical, ethnographic, and literary. We will cover topics such as colonial fantasies, decolonization, the political uses of social categories of tribe, caste, language and gender, the political economy of militarism, terrorism, 'development', activism, diasporic formations, poetry, music and art.

Storming the villa was just one example of a quest Germans had been undertaking since the Renaissance: to find German national identity with the help of Ancient Greece and Rome. Graeco-Roman antiquity provided the Germans with the first comprehensive description of their ancient ancestors in the Germania and their first national hero, Arminius. In this course, we will study the impact of that Greece and Rome had on German national identity starting in the 16th century when a group of poet-scholars transformed the Germania and Arminius into central components of German national identity. We will trace it through the Enlightenment in the 17th-18th centuries and into the age of imperialism in the 19th century when the first monument to Arminius was erected in Germany, the so-called Hermannsdenkmal (Monument to Arminius). We will end with how the Nazis reinterpreted the culture of Ancient Greece and Rome as a justification for fascism and violent nationalism. We will debate extensively and write in detail about questions of authority, identity, tolerance, intolerance, belonging, and ultimately why classical culture has been one of the most influential forces of the last 500 years. Our focus will lie on three key questions, each of incomparable relevance in today's world: 1. Why did German nationalists turn to Ancient Greece and Rome? Addressing this question will help us understand the decisive role classical antiquity has had since Rome fell in 476 CE 2. What specific mechanisms were used to interpret Graeco-Roman culture and knowledge? Answering this will allow us to evaluate how history is always in service of identity and power. 3. How did German identity develop? Evaluating this will help us understand how Renaissance-era poet-scholars were at the beginning of an identity creation that exploded in the 1900s.

Particular attention will be given to historical contexts in which thoughts are espoused and texts written. We plan to examine the development of political concepts and themes as articulated in diverse literary genres (e.g., legal, theological, political) from the eighth through 13th centuries. We hope to engage various theoretical models to analyze the relationship between politics and religion and to tease out the role of power in determining sociopolitical relations, distinctions, and structures. We hope to have a better grasp on the historicity of ideas presented in timeless categories in political discourse.

Focusing on reset diplomacy during the terms of five American and three Russian presidents since 1990, it reveals a familiar historical pattern that begins with high hopes, dialogue, and optimism only to be followed by vast disappointment, standoffs, and pessimism. Despite this dynamic, the course shows how and why the two countries have been able to cooperate at times to make substantial headway on critical issues such as arms control, nonproliferation of WMD, NATO expansion, counterterrorism, and economic and energy development, whereas at other times they have run afoul of major obstacles such as further NATO expansion, missile defense, and democracy and human rights in Russia. The course also examines how many political events created substantial challenges to U.S.-Russia relations, including the Balkan Wars; U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; Russia's wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Ukraine/Crimea; the Color Revolutions; the Arab Spring and subsequent civil wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya; the fight against ISIS and other militant Islamists; the threats posed by Iran and North Korea; the rise of China; espionage crises; hybrid wars; cyberattacks; and disinformation campaigns. Two vital questions frame the analysis: (1) Why has it been so difficult for these two great powers to develop a mutually beneficial relationship? (2) What would be required to move beyond the limited partnership to something more productive and sustaining? The course concludes by evaluating reset diplomacy and the ongoing attempts to move U.S.-Russia relations beyond a Hot Peace.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_4092","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Humanitarianism and Human Rights: Power, Paradigms, Protection","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 4092","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_4092_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schult, Anne"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Thu"],"time":[960,1130],"seats":[4,20]}]},"description":"This course charts the twin development of Western humanitarianism and human rights, with a particular focus on aid and protection as forms of European and US imperialism.

From about 1500 to the present, a number of hugely consequential things happened in Korea that have been called revolutionary-or what historians dub early modern and modern. Confucian kings planned large-scale projects that changed nature, rustic scholars made inventories of flora and fauna, colonial Koreans became biologists, nurses, and Edisons, and in North and South Korea, new professionals created distinctive-and in some cases, globally-competitive-regimes of knowing, making, and healing. Students will interrogate these developments as an opportunity to revisit the history of modernity, which has been told predominantly from the perspective of the West. What does it mean to be modern in Korea? How did that modernity intersect with Korean science, technology, and medicine?

We will consider questions such as: which traits and behaviors did the Greeks and the Romans associate with masculinity and with femininity? What can we tell from our sources about those who did not fit neatly into this binary? How did ancient Greeks and Romans think about male and female anatomy and psychology? How did the Greeks and the Romans construct sexuality and how did they approach homosexual and heterosexual relationships? How did they think about erotic desire? How did ancient laws and institutions circumscribe the lives of men and women, and how did they contribute to the construction of gender and sexuality? How did class, ethnicity, and age intersect with ideas about gender and sexuality in antiquity?  We will read an array of ancient texts in translation, we will consider various theoretical viewpoints, and we will move toward a better understanding of how gender and sexuality were constructed in antiquity. Ultimately, we will reflect on how our exploration of ancient ideas about these issues can help us understand better how we think about them today.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_2061","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Sophomore Seminar","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 2061","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_2061_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Kelly, Bridget L."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[2,19]},{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_2061_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Kelly, Bridget L."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"This course is a sophomore seminar in history; topics vary per semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_2802","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Sophomore Seminar: The Public Servant and Other Heroes: A History of Japan Through Film","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 2802","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_2802_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Watt, Lori"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[2,19]}],"lab":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_2802_A_U","number":"A","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Watt, Lori"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[1140,1290],"seats":[2,19]}]},"description":"This course is an examination of key turning points in Japan from the mid-19th century to the present. It focuses on the important role that bureaucracies, staffed by public servants, have played in shaping the political and social life on the archipelago and in the region. We will engage representations of political and social life in Japan by making use of its rich visual culture by viewing and discussing Japanese films. The assigned films, which will be screened in Japanese with English subtitles, will likely include The Twilight Samurai, To Live, and Shin Godzilla, among others. These films provide representations of how people in Japan have responded to crises, including revolution, war, and natural disasters. Through written and visual materials, students will gain a better understanding of history in Japan, public service, and the utility of film for engaging the past.

Through an in-depth exploration of the histories, cultures, and global connections of South Asia, a region encompassing the modern nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, we will trace the region's history from its early modern periods to the period of decolonization. Although anchored in the modern chronology of South Asia, the aim is to explore the subcontinent's global connections with Eastern and Southern Africa, the Indian Ocean World, the Middle East, East and Southeast Asia, and Western Europe. This means that students will acquire tools to understand themes such as colonization, modernization, democracy, and social change more broadly and apply them to other geographic regions. Themes include the early modern global economy, the rise and influence of Indo-Persianate culture, colonial encounters, the complex process of decolonization, and nation-building in the 20th century. Through the circulation of peoples, ideas, and objects we will explore the region's oceanic, subterranean, and peripheral connections that help us understand how South Asians experienced and historicized their history.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_511","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Teaching in History","catalogNumber":"HISTORY

Our attention will be directed to things as various as different forms of monasticism, the establishment of frontier communities, the culture of the Arabian peninsula, magic, paganism, military tactics, Romanesque churches, sea travel, manuscript illumination, the architecture of mosques, early medieval philosophy, the changing imagery of Christ, holiness, and violence as a redemptive act.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_3073","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"The Global War On Terrorism","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3073","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3073_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Knapp, Krister D"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[5,19]},{"id":"SEC_202502_HISTORY_3073_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Knapp, Krister D"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[10,19]}]},"description":"This course presents an historical assessment of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) from the perspective of its major participants: militant Sunni Islamist jihadists, especially the Al-Qaeda network, and the nation states that oppose them, particularly the United States and its allies.

However, this is an oversimplification that does not do justice to the diversity and complex history of Jewish identities, which are often multilayered. Strictly speaking, Sephardi Jews trace their ancestral lines or cultural heritage to the medieval Iberian Peninsula, present-day Spain and Portugal. That said, according to some scholars, Sephardi Judaism did not even exist before the general expulsion of Spanish Jewry in 1492 and is the result of their subsequent migrations within the Mediterranean and transatlantic worlds.    We will start with an introduction into the history of Spanish Jews prior to 1492, asking to what extent memories of pre-expulsion Iberia are at the heart of Sephardi identity. We will then follow the migratory path of Sephardi exiles to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Sephardim form a transnational community? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture in form of Ladino (Judeo-Spanish) language and literature? How did they become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was their role in Europe's transatlantic expansion and the slave trade? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends in the nineteenth century and create their own forms of modernity?

We will ask, in particular, how gender, race, slavery, colonialism and empire shape conceptions of citizenship and property. We will also examine transnational feminist critiques of the public/private division in the Western political theory canon as it impacts the role of women and the social construction of women's bodies. During the second half of the semester, we will ask how various transnational social movements have engaged and adopted feminist theories in efforts to resist state violence, colonialism, labor exploitation and resource extraction. In following these lines of inquiry we will draw from postcolonial, decolonial, liberal, Black, radical, Marxist and Chicana feminist perspectives.

The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable.  At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies.  The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the  evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts.   This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation literacy that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities.  Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that literacy include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_LWST_1ABR","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Interdisciplinary Project in The Humanities","title":"Legal Studies Coursework Completed Abroad","catalogNumber":"LWST 1ABR","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_LWST_1ABR_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Lovett, Frank"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"This course number is for students who plan to study abroad.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_LWST_263","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Interdisciplinary Project in The Humanities","title":"Linguistics for Legal Purposes","catalogNumber":"LWST 263","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_LWST_263_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Biggs, Henry"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,21]}]},"description":"This course exposes students to an array of legal matters in which forensic linguistic science can play a key role.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

To achieve genuine refugee/ Migrant oriented reform policies, the Global North needs to reconcile with its colonial past. Towards this end, we will highlight how the history of Migration is deeply entangled with colonialism.  Our readings-based discussions will focus on analyzing how colonial logics continue to shape the dynamics of migration as well as fuel the growing Xenophobia and Anti-migration rhetoric in the Global North towards intercontinental human mobility.  To understand the enduring legacies of colonialism on the contemporary politics of migration, our discussions will argue the premise that colonial histories should be central to migration studies today for there to be real reform in refugee, asylum, and migrant policies. We will explore a wide range of inspiring and challenging perspectives on migration and learn what postcolonial and decolonial scholarships can offer us studying international migration today. We will address these areas through our weekly readings of Migration Studies and Colonialism as a primary source; we will also survey a selection of articles as a secondary source. To supplement the readings, we will watch short documentaries addressing the topic as well as hear from activists, journalists, and specialists in the field.

In this class we combine a historical understanding of the social caste structure with the insights made by those who have worked to annihilate caste. We will re-visit history with the analytic tools provided by the concepts of compulsory endogamy, surplus woman, and brahmanical patriarchy, and we will build an understanding of the enduring yet invisible sexual-caste complex. As we will see, caste has always relied on sexual difference, its ever-mutating power enabled by the intersectionalities of race, gender and class. We'll learn how caste adapts to every twist in world history, increasingly taking root outside India and South Asia. We will delve into film and memoir, sources that document the incessant injustices of caste and how they have compounded under globalization. The class will research the exchange of concepts between anti-race and anti-caste activists: how caste has shaped the work of prominent anti-racist intellectuals and activists in the United States such as W.E.B. DuBois and Isabel Wilkerson and in turn, the agenda and creativity of groups such as the Dalit Panthers.

First imagined as an anti-majoritarian and anti-imperial idea, the nation came to be  split between East and West Pakistan, with a hostile Indian nation dividing the country. The subsequent emergence of Bangladesh, from within, exposed the complexities of US imperial and Indian power, colonialism, identity, ethnicity, race, nationalism and repression. More recently, the War on Terror has once again exploited the ethnic and cultural conflicts produced by world histories of power and resistance.  The events of the past two hundred years have undoubtedly and violently exacerbated the politicization of social and cultural identities. This course situates Pakistan in the context of pre-colonial social formations, British colonialism, internal colonialism, US imperialism, the Cold War, Soviet interests, Indian regional hegemony and then turns to the powerful and diverse struggles launched by its own citizens against these external forces. How did successive empires construct and politicize social identities, and how did people contest and adapt these? How did caste, gender, race and religion shape empire and anti-imperial histories?  Our sources will be historical, ethnographic, and literary. We will cover topics such as colonial fantasies, decolonization, the political uses of social categories of tribe, caste, language and gender, the political economy of militarism, terrorism, 'development', activism, diasporic formations, poetry, music and art. The course will deepen our collective understanding of a critical series of developments in world history. Just as crucially, we will build a framework within which to address the stereotypes about Pakistan that dominate popular and media discourses today.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HBRW-L74_3082","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"From the Temple to the Talmud: The Emergence of Rabbinic Judaism","catalogNumber":"HBRW-L74 3082","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HBRW-L74_3082_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Jacobs, Martin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[0,19]}]},"description":"This course offers a survey of the historical, literary, social, and conceptual development of Rabbinic Judaism from its emergence in late antiquity to the early Middle Ages.

Particular attention will be given to historical contexts in which thoughts are espoused and texts written.

We hope to engage various theoretical models to analyze the relationship between politics and religion and to tease out the role of power in determining sociopolitical relations, distinctions, and structures. We hope to have a better grasp on the historicity of ideas presented in timeless categories in political discourse.

In this class, we consider the history and politics behind the answers to these kinds of questions. To do so, we examine the field of Middle East Studies in the United States, historically and today, and its role in the production of expert knowledge about the region. After learning foundational theories around knowledge production, we consider the history of US foreign policy and analyze how certain theories of the Middle East became common sense notions at the expense of other possibilities. We then investigate the history and politics of universal concepts and their promotion in the region such as human rights, gender equality, and religious freedom.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HBRW-L74_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"HBRW-L74 500","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HBRW-L74_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Barmash, Pamela"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_HINDI_499","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"HINDI 499","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HINDI_499_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARAB_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Work","catalogNumber":"ARAB 500","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARAB_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARAB_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_HBRW-L74_489","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Work for Senior Honors","catalogNumber":"HBRW-L74 489","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_HBRW-L74_489_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Barmash, Pamela"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]}]},"description":"This course to be taken in the spring semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARAB_489","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Work for Senior Honors","catalogNumber":"ARAB 489","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARAB_489_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Tarbouni, Younasse"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARAB_489_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Bennis, Housni"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"This course to be taken in the spring semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_JIMES_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Independent Work in Jewish, Islamic and Near Eastern Studies","catalogNumber":"JIMES 500","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Reynolds, Nancy Y"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Nakissa, Aria Daniel"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_500_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":[""],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_JIMES_208D","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Intermediate Arabic II","catalogNumber":"JIMES 208D","units":4,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_208D_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Tarbouni, Younasse"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[1,15]}],"lab":[{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_208D_A_D","number":"A","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Tarbouni, Younasse"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Thu"],"time":[540,590],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"Continuation of Intermediate Arabic I.

Although the virulence of the discussions may have given us the impression that this was a new issue, in reality the question of the Jews' role and involvement in Jesus' death has been disputed for almost two thousand years. The claim that the Jews are responsible for Christ's death is the subject of this class and we will study its history from the gospels to today using textual sources (historical, religious and literary works) and the visual arts (paintings and movies). But this class is not about who did or did not kill Jesus, nor is it about judging people's positions on the issue.

Should a religious tradition adapt in response to modern technological, political, economic, or social change? If so, how? These are just some of the questions that Muslim thinkers and believers have asked themselves since the 18th and 19th centuries, as they have engaged the global transformations commonly known as 'modernity'.  Our examination of modern Islam in all its diversity considers a wide range of themes. These can include: new approaches to reading the Qur'an and Scripture; the impact of material goods and modern technologies; women's religious authority; Islamic law in the courtroom and nation-state; democracy, politics, and social activism; traditionalism and environmentalism; as well as the often fraught debates around the emergence of groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).  The course's geographical center of gravity is the Middle East, and we also consider other key regions including sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of key Muslim responses to the global transformations commonly known as modernity. They will acquire the skills to critically analyze widely used concepts such as 'tradition' to explore in depth both the work of Muslim intellectuals and the everyday experiences of ordinary believers in modern times.

This pattern has long been replicated in films where Muslims are static and dehumanized perpetrators of violence, or as symbols of a backwards and depraved culture, antithetical to liberal values and interests. In recent years however, Muslims have become increasingly visible in the American and British entertainment industries, as protagonists and producers of their own media, including G. Willow Wilson's Ms. Marvel, Hulu's Ramy, and Netflix's Man Like Mobeen. In this seminar, we explore a selection of recent American and British media projects created by Muslim writers, actors, musicians, and comedians. We pair these projects with scholarship on religion in the media and TV studies analyzing Muslim representation and storytelling in contemporary popular culture. We will evaluate these works on their own terms, noting the ways in which gender and racial hierarchies dictate who gets to represent American and British Muslims, while also assessing how these new media both disrupt and further reify Muslims' construction as religious and political outsiders.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_JIMES_374","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Of Dishes, Taste, and Class: History of Food in the Middle East","catalogNumber":"JIMES 374","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_JIMES_374_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Yucesoy, Hayrettin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[900,1010],"seats":[5,15]}]},"description":"This course will cover the history of food and drink in the Middle East to help us understand our complex relation with food and look at our lives from perspectives we intuitively feel or by implication know, but rarely critically and explicitly reflect on.

Beginning with the earliest human occupations in the region more than 12,000 years ago, this course examines how domestication, urbanization, the rise of early states, and major technological inventions changed life in the Andes from small village societies to the largest territorial polity of the Americas - the Inca Empire. Students will become familiar with the major debates in the field of Andean archaeology. Together, we will examine archaeological evidence (architecture, art, ceramics, metals, textiles, plant and animal remains, etc.) from context of everyday life (households, food production, craft production) to the rituals and ceremonies (offerings, tombs) that took place in domestic and public spaces.

When working with each linguistic subsystem, students are provided with opportunities to reflect on and improve their own abilities in Spanish, such as with regard to how mood (indicative versus subjunctive) and aspect (preterit versus imperfect) work in the Spanish verbal system. Similarities and differences between Spanish and other languages, such as English, are highlighted. The course also provides students with an introduction to the history of Spanish in its evolution from Latin as one of many Romance languages (a diachronic view) and an exploration of various regional varieties of Spanish today (a synchronic view). The goals of the course include understanding linguistics and Hispanic linguistics as cognitive sciences; understanding language acquisition and use as neural processes; disentangling linguistic rules and linguistic variation from pedagogical rules and stigmatization; and applying one's knowledge of linguistics in general and Hispanic linguistics in particular to practical issues and challenges. This course will have a strong, mandatory and graded oral communications component, and it is taught in Spanish. Prior or concurrent enrollment in Spanish 303 is required.

How do singers manipulate the sound of their voice, the gendered associations carried by that sound, and the assumptions about the body which produces it? Are queer musical acts a mode of performance or a way of being, and who decides? We will analyze a range of examples from the past and from contemporary popular culture: soft masculinities, cowboy and country personas, cross-dressing in music theater, lip-syncing drag queens and kings, high-femme divas, and performers of androgynous, cyborg, and post-human aesthetics.

It relies on anime visuals, scratchy jazz samples, and repetitive drum loops. It serves primarily as background music.   This course is about the sounds and popularity of lofi hip hop in the twenty-first century. But to understand this genre, students will also focus on the genre's roots. We learn about French composers' early attempts to create background music at the turn of the twentieth century. We learn about American teenagers who took over their suburban garages to create an energetic style of rock and roll during the 1960s. We learn about how anthropologists during the 1930s thought that low fidelity recordings of blues and country musicians was evidence of their musical authenticity. And we will learn about how jazz harmonies and samples influenced the music of groups like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. Lofi gives us a jumping off point for exploring a wide range of genres and histories.    The final assignment will be a collaborative effort. As a class, students will make and publish a podcast about lofi hip hop and its antecedents. This podcast will feature original lofi hip hop made by the class. The original music will also serve as background music to a study-session event organized by the class towards the end of the semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MUSIC_4190","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Music","title":"Selected Areas for Special Study I","catalogNumber":"MUSIC 4190","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_MUSIC_4190_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Wangpaiboonkit, Parkorn"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[600,770],"seats":[0,8]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_MUSIC_519","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Music","title":"Selected Areas for Special Study I: Music And/As Social Life","catalogNumber":"MUSIC 519","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_MUSIC_519_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Burke, Patrick Lawrence"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[600,770],"seats":[4,8]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_MUSIC_521","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Music","title":"Seminar in Music Theory: The Solo Songs of Johannes Brahms","catalogNumber":"MUSIC 521","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_MUSIC_521_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Snarrenberg, Robert"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[2,8]}]},"description":"The Chamber Music of Brahms.

Rather than taking a chronological approach, we will investigate similar phenomena from disparate places and times. For instance, we will study castrati and the BeeGees in the same week, considering how men who sing higher than we think they should unlocks a host of historically contingent desires and anxieties. Student from any discipline are welcome in this course; musical knowledge will be built and not assumed. Although we will focus on the voice in music, we will also consider adjacent media that particularly center the voice, specifically film and ASMR.  Note: Although we will focus on gender and sexuality, it is impossible to properly handle gender and sexuality without considering how other identity factors (race, class, ability, etc.) influence our perception of voice, gender, and sexuality.

The second, defined in part by new social media, podcasting, and on-line video, is remaking the way comedians find their voices and their audiences. But even as young comedians chart new paths through a dynamic media landscape, live performance is still the heart of the modern comedy universe. This class is a detailed survey of the contemporary American comedy scene. Pioneering artists from Vaudeville through the 1970s are introduced, the stand-up boom of the 1980s is presented as a formative force in the comedy business, alt-comedy is discussed as a stylistic watershed. Select modern theories of comedy are read and discussed (though we studiously avoid explaining jokes). Short units on Improv and Sketch comedy round out the syllabus.

We will discuss plays that are rewritten in order to reflect new historical contexts and audience sensibilities, paying special attention to revisions that engage with emergent social and political realities. We will also emphasize the repossession that occurs as new productions seek to include a greater diversity of racial and gender identities.

Although the course will be focused on efforts to describe and prescribe theories of drama, dramatic genre, and theatrical pleasure, it will also position play scripts alongside the theoretical treatises that guide or are guided by them.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_DANCE_493","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Senior Project","catalogNumber":"DANCE 493","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_DANCE_493_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Douthit, Antonio Maurice"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_DANCE_493_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Marchant, David W."],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_DANCE_493_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Slaughter, Cecil L."],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_DANCE_493_05_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Das, Joanna Dee"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]}]},"description":"Specialized project in a selected area in dance.

It is perhaps for this reason that Shakespeare's work has continued to shape subsequent theatrical and film productions. This course will examine the recent adaptations of Shakespeare's work that have originated on the Broadway stage and in Hollywood movie studios. We will look at the many alterations that were made to Shakespeare's original plays from shifted settings to changes to the characters' ages and vocations to the addition of music to modernized dialogue. We will consider how these modern adaptations link the early modern period with our own by examining how these theatrical and film productions build upon the plays' engagements with love and family as well as the social issues of race, gender, and social class. We will also draw a connection between these adaptations and Shakespeare's own creative practice of crafting his plays by revising earlier source materials. Most importantly, we think about how these adaptations simultaneously make Shakespeare's plays more accessible and current for a contemporary audience while also serving to certify the timelessness of these stories.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_DANCE_499","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Study for Honors","catalogNumber":"DANCE

This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation literacy that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities.  Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that literacy include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_PHIL_4315","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Philosophy","title":"Normative Ethical Theory","catalogNumber":"PHIL 4315","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_PHIL_4315_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Baril, Anne Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[11,19]}]},"description":"An exploration of the three major normative ethical theories debated by philosophers in the last hundred years: Kantian ethics, utilitarianism, and virtue theory.

Some areas to be explored:  1. Can consciousness be addressed like any other biological property in the sense that it has evolved by natural selection and that some elements of it are present in simple model systems, such as the fruit fly?  Can insight be gained studying simple model systems? 2. Where in the brain is consciousness?  What is the pattern of neurological events that occurs during consciousness?  Is brain activity generating consciousness localized or distributed?  Does it involve interacting brain regions?  Does brain activity generating consciousness migrate to different brain regions? 3. How does the dynamic core hypothesis of Edelman relate to these questions?  What can functional brain imaging add to these questions?  Are Gamma waves involved in higher mental activity, and do they promote synchronized firing of neurons from different brain areas?  How does this relate to the binding problem? 4. How does the brain's ability to function as a computer relate to consciousness? In many respects the brain functions as a computer using electrical signals called Action Potentials.  Action potentials in neuronal networks function in an analogous was as DC electrical impulses function in computer circuits.  What is the output of computation in an electrical device?  What are the theoretical limitations regarding what computation can achieve and ask whether electrical activity in the brain also has a fundamentally different purpose in addition to computation. 5.  Is our knowledge of the physical world too primitive and incomplete to understand consciousness?  The brain is an electronic device and consciousness clearly depends on its electrical activity.  Yet, electrical forces are poorly understood, both in the context of classical physics and quantum physics.  Will understanding consciousness have to wait for a unified theory that more accurately describes electrical forces?  Prerequisites: Bio3411 or equivalent.

This class is designed to bend your mind when figuring out why clocks run slower when approaching the edge of a black hole, what could be at the center of a black hole or even at the other side. At the same time, we will discuss the inner workings of the most advanced telescopes that astronomers have developed to study black holes, and the strategies astronomers employ to develop ever more sensitive instruments. Also expect a fair bit of astronomy in this class, when we discuss how black holes form, when and how they grow, and which roles they play in cosmic eco-systems such as the Milky Way Galaxy.

The first asks how feminist thinkers from various traditions critique and engage the history of political thought within the social contract tradition. We will ask, in particular, how gender, race, slavery, colonialism and empire shape conceptions of citizenship and property. We will also examine transnational feminist critiques of the public/private division in the Western political theory canon as it impacts the role of women and the social construction of women's bodies. During the second half of the semester, we will ask how various transnational social movements have engaged and adopted feminist theories in efforts to resist state violence, colonialism, labor exploitation and resource extraction. In following these lines of inquiry we will draw from postcolonial, decolonial, liberal, Black, radical, Marxist and Chicana feminist perspectives.

Territorial conflict is also found to be one of the most frequent causes of intrastate violence and civil war onset. At a theoretical level, territory is central to almost any aspect of international relations, as it is what physically defines states, where any kind of violent conflict takes place, and influences the character of violent conflict in important ways. A large empirical literature convincingly shows that territory is a key determinant of international conflict. However, much remains unexplored both theoretically and empirically.   In this course, we explore the role that territory plays in a wide variety of contexts. We motivate the course by noting that although territory has been shown to be empirically central to the majority of violent disputes, explanations for why this is the case lag behind the evidence. Subsequently, we study the role territory plays in state-making, international conflict, the settlement of disputes, international trade, international investment, the effectiveness of treaties, ethnic identity, and civil wars, among others. Week by week we pay particular attention to the central theoretical role territory plays in international relations. We will put particular emphasis on thinking about how territory relates to bargaining models of conflict.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_POLSCI_3300","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"Terrorism and Counterterrorism","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 3300","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_POLSCI_3300_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Wayne, Carly Nicole"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[38,44]}]},"description":"What is terrorism, when is it used, and how can we stop it?

We will also explore the strategic logic of terrorism - why do individuals choose to engage in this practice and why it is an effective or ineffective tactic of political violence? Importantly, we will also examine the psychology of terrorism, investigating how the mass public and state leaders react to and cope with terrorist violence. Specific examples of potential topics include: the use of terrorism in anti-colonial and separatist movements, the history of terrorism in the United States from the Ku Klux Klan to jihadism, the post 9/11 War on Terror, and the resurgence of white nationalist terrorism around the world.

Throughout this course, students will embark on a journey to understand how health has been defined within the global context, exploring the historical evolution of public and global health disciplines as well as contemporary issues within the field. Delving into the ethical landscape of global health research, programming, and policy, students will articulate human rights issues and examine approaches ensuring ethical interventions. The course will shed light on the intricate interplay of social determinants of health, unraveling their impact on well-being and the emergence of health inequities. By examining both successes and failures in global health interventions, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the challenges inherent in the field. Furthermore, the course will foster a comparative analysis of the organization, structure, and function of diverse healthcare systems across international settings. Finally, with a focus on morbidity and mortality, students will explore major causes, trends, and measures of infectious and chronic disease, as well as some underappreciated and emerging issues, providing a holistic perspective on the critical issues shaping the landscape of public and global health today. We will engage with class topics through a range of mediums, including book chapters, scientific papers, media pieces, podcasts, guest lectures from leaders in the field, and TED talks.

It will examine how and why religious groups have mobilized within the legal arena at various points in US history, the devotional commitments that influence their activism, the constitutional claims and counterclaims that have emerged over time as a result of legal contestation, and the lived impact of various judicial decisions. To do so, the course will be structured thematically around three overlapping constitutional domains: (1) equal protection rights for women and sexual minorities, (2) substantive due process commitments to privacy and bodily autonomy, and (3) free speech principles related to sexual self-expression. The impact of religious advocacy on contemporary controversies such as drag show bans, restrictions on reproductive healthcare, religious exemptions to LGBT non-discrimination laws, pornography regulation, gender-affirming care access, and more will all be covered.  By applying the theories and methods of critical religious studies, this course also takes questions of American religion and sexual politics as a starting point for introducing undergraduate students to legal studies more generally. Through classroom conversations and course texts, students will become familiar with the structure of the American legal system, different methods of constitutional interpretation, theoretical concerns that shape legal thinking, and critical reading skills that may be used to approach legal texts such as judicial opinions.

Were religious critiques of mass media valid, particularly around questions of access, constraints, and consumption? And how have religious groups experimented with communications technologies to reimagine their use, message, and audience?

The rise of a new public presence of Islam and the growth of children of Muslim immigrants to adulthood have challenged notions that Europe is a secular or post-Christian space.  Finally, the heightened authority of European institutions has challenged the nation-state from above, and the granting of new forms of subnational autonomy to regions and peoples has challenged it from below. The new Europe is increasingly constituted by way of regional identifications, transnational movement(s), and umbrella European legal and political organizations; these new realities occasion new rhetorics of secularism, nationalism, and ethnic loyalties.

How did the Rabbis emerge as a movement after the destruction of the Second Temple and how could they replace the old priestly elite? How did Rabbinic Judaism develop in its two centers of origin, Palestine (the Land of Israel) and Babylonia (Iraq), to become the dominant form of Judaism under the rule of Islam? How did Jewish ritual and liturgy develop under Rabbinic influence? How were the Rabbis organized and was there diversity within the group? What was the Rabbis' view of women, how did they perceive non-Rabbinic Jews and non-Jews?

While most accounts have focused on Catholic priests, many have also emerged of abusive evangelical and other Protestant ministers. The stories have illuminated how church bureaucrats have consistently protected abusers and subverted the efforts of victims and their families to seek recompense, accountability, and justice. These protections have often succeeded because of churches' political connections to law enforcement and legislators who have helped hide perpetrators and stymie survivors. Together we will analyze this cautionary tale about religion and politics by contextualizing it within the broader history of Christianity in the United States and beyond. Is this a case simply of a few bad apples or of institutional corruption? How has the church's response been shaped by fear of scandal, antipathy toward secularism, and theological teachings on gender and homosexuality? How does sexual abuse fit into the history of the church as a hierarchical institution? What challenges has the crisis posed to people of faith who are committed to the church, and can trust be repaired? Readings include legal case studies, internal church correspondence, victims' statements and criminal justice reports, documentary films and memoirs, and both journalistic and scholarly analysis of the clergy sex abuse crisis in the U.S. church.

Strictly speaking, Sephardi Jews trace their ancestral lines or cultural heritage to the medieval Iberian Peninsula, present-day Spain and Portugal. That said, according to some scholars, Sephardi Judaism did not even exist before the general expulsion of Spanish Jewry in 1492 and is the result of their subsequent migrations within the Mediterranean and transatlantic worlds.    We will start with an introduction into the history of Spanish Jews prior to 1492, asking to what extent memories of pre-expulsion Iberia are at the heart of Sephardi identity. We will then follow the migratory path of Sephardi exiles to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Sephardim form a transnational community? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture in form of Ladino (Judeo-Spanish) language and literature? How did they become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was their role in Europe's transatlantic expansion and the slave trade?

It focuses on the main linguistic subsystems: the sound system (phonetics and phonology), the formation and use of words (morphology), and the formation and structure of sentences (syntax). When working with each linguistic subsystem, students are provided with opportunities to reflect on and improve their own abilities in Spanish, such as with regard to how mood (indicative versus subjunctive) and aspect (preterit versus imperfect) work in the Spanish verbal system. Similarities and differences between Spanish and other languages, such as English, are highlighted. The course also provides students with an introduction to the history of Spanish in its evolution from Latin as one of many Romance languages (a diachronic view) and an exploration of various regional varieties of Spanish today (a synchronic view). The goals of the course include understanding linguistics and Hispanic linguistics as cognitive sciences; understanding language acquisition and use as neural processes; disentangling linguistic rules and linguistic variation from pedagogical rules and stigmatization; and applying one's knowledge of linguistics in general and Hispanic linguistics in particular to practical issues and challenges. This course will have a strong, mandatory and graded oral communications component, and it is taught in Spanish. Prior or concurrent enrollment in Spanish 303 is required.

More recently, the La Manada gang rape case in Pamplona in July 2016 provoked national outrage, and, together with the #MeToo and the #NiUnaMenos movements in the United States and Latin America, a global feminist movement was mobilized to protest sexual assault, femicide, and all other forms of gender-based violence. We will consider the works of 19th-century through present-day Spanish women writers, jouranlists, and filmmakers, including Emilia Pardo Bazan, Carmen de Burgos, Rosa Montero, Carme Riera, Lucia Etxebarria, Isabel Coixet, Iciar Bollain, and Roser Aguilar, who have spoken out against gender violence in a variety of fora. Their works will serve as points of departure for exploring the social and cultural causes and dynamics of gender-based violence as well as the ways in which Spanish women have responded to this problem in their writings, film, and other forms of representation. Our analysis will be informed by the larger historical framework of the development of feminism in Spain as well as by the recent global movement against gender-based violence. Course assignments will consist of daily readings, film viewings, group oral presentations, quizzes, discussion forum posts, and a final project that is orally based; students are also expected to engage actively in class discussions and in small group work. This course will have a strong, mandatory and graded oral communications component, and it is taught in Spanish. Prior or concurrent enrollment in Spanish 303 is required.

We will analyze how curatorial language inhabits not only writing but visual culture, speech, heritage collections, gallery installations, and even architecture, fashion, and food. We will discuss how the instability of curatorial discourse reveals the instability and contradictions within cultural heritage itself, deceivingly presented constantly as a neutral, unchangeable, and unquestionable entity. The materials and reflections in this course will ponder on cultural heritage as inevitably curated, discern the forms and implications of such mediation, and study curatorial practice and the trade of the curator as a form of agency that should aim to be ethical, inclusive, collaborative, and always challenged and renewed.  We will work with a wide variety of materials from the early 20th century to contemporary Mexico that range from gallery and museum texts to political speeches, mass-media dispatches, literary texts, scholarly research, critical essays, interviews, fiction, magazine articles, manifestos, fashion statements, food menus, and architecture. These will lead us to reflect on how curatorial practice is a dynamic tool for understanding, renewing, preserving, and sometimes defying cultural heritage and what it stands for at different times and for different people.  *This course has a substantial, mandatory and graded written communications component and is taught in Spanish.

The course is organized in three parts. Part I surveys the late 19th- and early 20th-century development of the parental state, including its institutional centerpiece (the juvenile court), its principle legal subjects (dependents and delinquents), and how these took shape alongside the contemporaneous rise of American Apartheid. Part II examines several key changes and challenges in contemporary juvenile justice, including the transformation of this institution in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement and the endurance of racialized juvenile social control in the post-Civil Rights period. Finally, Part III considers possible futures of youth justice in the United States and beyond as well as practical strategies for achieving equal protection within and beyond the law.

Along these themes, the course will consider key concepts such as race, gender, class, sexuality, nation, language, law/justice, generation, space/place, and social change. The course will use an intersectional, social justice framework to discern how media reflects, commodifies, oppresses, liberates, and constructs social life.

The course begins by inquiring how sociologists understand racial distinctions, asking: What comprises a racial group? What constitutes a group in the social sense? The course then shifts to explore patterns of racial inequality in the U.S., particularly through investigating the intersections of economic, political, and racial stratification. After analyzing national trends in racial stratification, the course narrows its focus to particular regions and metropolitan areas, including St. Louis, to shed light on pressing public concerns such as the interrelationships between race and the criminal justice system. The course ends by looking beyond U.S. borders to compare the way that race is understood in other countries. Are there common patterns of racial classification shared by many societies?

It will examine how and why religious groups have mobilized within the legal arena at various points in US history, the devotional commitments that influence their activism, the constitutional claims and counterclaims that have emerged over time as a result of legal contestation, and the lived impact of various judicial decisions. To do so, the course will be structured thematically around three overlapping constitutional domains: (1) equal protection rights for women and sexual minorities, (2) substantive due process commitments to privacy and bodily autonomy, and (3) free speech principles related to sexual self-expression. The impact of religious advocacy on contemporary controversies such as drag show bans, restrictions on reproductive healthcare, religious exemptions to LGBT non-discrimination laws, pornography regulation, gender-affirming care access, and more will all be covered.  By applying the theories and methods of critical religious studies, this course also takes questions of American religion and sexual politics as a starting point for introducing undergraduate students to legal studies more generally. Through classroom conversations and course texts, students will become familiar with the structure of the American legal system, different methods of constitutional interpretation, theoretical concerns that shape legal thinking, and critical reading skills that may be used to approach legal texts such as judicial opinions. Students from all academic backgrounds interested in gaining increased literacy in American law are encouraged to enroll-no prior exposure is required.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_3266","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Black Masculinities","catalogNumber":"WGSS 3266","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_3266_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Manditch-Prottas, Zachary Daniel"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_366","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Caste: Sexuality, Race and Globalization.","catalogNumber":"WGSS 366","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_366_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Chandra, Shefali"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[7,25]}]},"description":"Be it sati or enforced widowhood, arranged or love marriage, the rise of national leaders like Indira Gandhi and Kamala Harris, or the obsession with fair skin, caste shapes possibilities and perceptions for billions. In this class we combine a historical understanding of the social caste structure with the insights made by those who have worked to annihilate caste. We will re-visit history with the analytic tools provided by the concepts of compulsory endogamy, surplus woman, and brahmanical patriarchy, and we will build an understanding of the enduring yet invisible sexual-caste complex. As we will see, caste has always relied on sexual difference, its ever-mutating power enabled by the intersectionalities of race, gender and class. We'll learn how caste adapts to every twist in world history, increasingly taking root outside India and South Asia. We will delve into film and memoir, sources that document the incessant injustices of caste and how they have compounded under globalization. The class will research the exchange of concepts between anti-race and anti-caste activists: how caste has shaped the work of prominent anti-racist intellectuals and activists in the United States such as W.E.B. DuBois and Isabel Wilkerson and in turn, the agenda and creativity of groups such as the Dalit Panthers. Finally, the course will build a practical guide to engaging with and interrupting caste in the context of the contemporary global world today.

Service work in community engagement placements enables students to ask how their understanding of social change is challenged when put into practice and how communities can and should shape academic discourse. Course assignments ask students to evaluate both academic and community praxis (theory in practice) with the goal of creating a more just and equitable St. Louis.

However, these abysmal statistics do not reflect the reality that female directors are producing some of the most innovative and exciting films of the 21st century. This course is intended to provide a general overview of the remarkable contributions of women directors to contemporary cinema (1990 to present). First, we will turn our attention to women in the commercial industry, examining topics such as female authorship, popular genres, and the gender politics of production cultures in Hollywood. Then, we will survey women directors working outside of the system in documentary, independent, and experimental filmmaking modes. Finally, we will adopt a transnational perspective to investigate the contributions of women directors to world cinema, contextualizing the films of women cinéastes from countries such as Hong Kong, Argentina, and Iran in relation to their national cinemas and international film festival networks. In addition, we will discuss the films of women directors in terms of feminist and gender issues and as texts that clarify critical issues in film analysis, interpretation, and criticism.

Under English rule from the 12th-century Norman invasions to the establishment of the Irish Free State and the partition of Northern Ireland in 1922, Ireland presents a compelling historical laboratory to deliberate on the relationship between gender and political conflict. Intentionally transdisciplinary, the course draws from across disciplinary discourses and highlights perspectives across race, gender, class, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality. Topics include political organizing, nationalism, rebellion, radicalization, militarism, terrorism, pacifism, and peacebuilding. Rooted in Cynthia Enloe's enduring question of Where are the women? and drawing on sociologist Louise Ryan's landmark essay by the same name, we inquire how and why Irish nationalist women, who were integral to building the revolutionary movement, became Furies and Die-hards in the eyes of their compatriots when the Free State was established (Bishop Doorley, 1925; President Cosgrave, 1923).

Our approach to examining these categories/vectors of power will include feminisms of color, critical race theory/studies, queer theory/studies, queer of color critique, transgender theory/studies, and critical geography, all of which have shaped and been shaped by intersectionality.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_100B","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Introduction to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","catalogNumber":"WGSS 100B","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Cislo, Amy Eisen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[7,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Cislo, Amy Eisen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[16,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Esparza, Rene"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[12,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Barounis, Cynthia Rose"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[19,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_05_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Reed, Allison Schuyler"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[20,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_06_S","number":"06","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Windle, Elisabeth A"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[14,25]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_100B_07_S","number":"07","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Willden, Bailey"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[7,25]}]},"description":"This course will provide an introduction to the foundational concepts, histories, and theories that form the interdisciplinary field of women, gender and sexuality studies.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

While most accounts have focused on Catholic priests, many have also emerged of abusive evangelical and other Protestant ministers. The stories have illuminated how church bureaucrats have consistently protected abusers and subverted the efforts of victims and their families to seek recompense, accountability, and justice. These protections have often succeeded because of churches' political connections to law enforcement and legislators who have helped hide perpetrators and stymie survivors. Together we will analyze this cautionary tale about religion and politics by contextualizing it within the broader history of Christianity in the United States and beyond. Is this a case simply of a few bad apples or of institutional corruption? How has the church's response been shaped by fear of scandal, antipathy toward secularism, and theological teachings on gender and homosexuality? How does sexual abuse fit into the history of the church as a hierarchical institution? What challenges has the crisis posed to people of faith who are committed to the church, and can trust be repaired? Readings include legal case studies, internal church correspondence, victims' statements and criminal justice reports, documentary films and memoirs, and both journalistic and scholarly analysis of the clergy sex abuse crisis in the U.S. church.

From hygienic campaigns against Mexican immigrants in early-1900s California to the 1991 quarantine of Haitian refugees with HIV at Guantanamo Bay, race and sexuality have proven crucial to how society identifies health and, by extension, determines who is fit to be a citizen. This interdisciplinary course interrogates the intersections of race, sexuality, and medicine, discussing how each domain has been constitutive of the other in the American context. Via feminist and queer theorizing, we will examine the political and economic factors under which diseases, illnesses, and health campaigns have impacted racial and sexual minorities over the last two centuries. An orienting question for the course is the following: How has the state wielded public health as a regulatory site to legitimatize perceived racial differences and to regulate ostensible sexual deviations? Through primary and secondary sources, we will likewise explore the various forms of health activism undertaken by these very same targeted populations. Themes to be addressed will include the medicalization of racial and sexual difference; activism both in and against health institutions; and the roles of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability in contemporary health issues. Case studies include the Tuskegee syphilis experiment; the sterilization of black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American women; the medicalization of homosexuality during the Cold War; and the role of mass incarceration in the diffusion of HIV. At a moment in time when access to health continues to be shaped by categories of social difference, understanding the role of public health in the normalization and subversion of racial and sexual hierarchies in the West is more pertinent than ever.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_318A","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Topics in American Literature","catalogNumber":"WGSS 318A","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_318A_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Micir, Melanie Andrea"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,18]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_4501","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Topics in American Politics:","catalogNumber":"WGSS 4501","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_4501_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Spriggs, James F"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[840,1010],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_3083","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Topics in Asian American Lit: Gender and Sexuality in American Literature","catalogNumber":"WGSS 3083","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_3083_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Eng, Chris"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[0,15]}]},"description":"Topics in Asian American literature which will vary from semester to semester.

We will also explore the gray areas existing in between binaries such as feminist/anti-feminist; local/global; home/away; global South/North; victim/agent; domination/dependency. Finally, we will ask how processes of knowledge-production take shape within different intellectual and political movements such as post-colonial feminism, decolonial and indigenous feminism, liberal and radical feminism, Marxist feminism and religiously-based feminisms.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_5245","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Transnational Feminisms","catalogNumber":"WGSS 5245","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_5245_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Brown, Rachel Harriet"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[3,25]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_2991","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Undergraduate Teaching Assistant","catalogNumber":"WGSS 2991","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Wanzo, Rebecca Ann"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Kimoto, Tamsin"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Chandra, Shefali"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Bailey, Marlon Murtha"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_05_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Brown, Rachel Harriet"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_06_S","number":"06","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Reed, Allison Schuyler"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_08_S","number":"08","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Cislo, Amy Eisen"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[2,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_09_S","number":"09","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Barounis, Cynthia Rose"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_10_S","number":"10","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Sangrey, Trevor Joy"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_WGSS_2991_11_S","number":"11","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Ake, Jami L"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[3,0]}]},"description":"In this course an advanced undergraduate can assist a faculty member in the teaching of an introductory level Women and Gender Studies course.

This course will travel to Brazil over spring break (March 10-16, 2024) and introduce students to understanding LGBTQ human rights and policy issues from an international perspective, with a strong focus on intersectional experiences of race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. South America is undergoing a major cultural shift in the areas of gender related issues and sexual identity, moving from a conservative, male heterosexual dominated culture to a more open, liberal, and gender equal society. Several South American countries, such as Brazil, have been the unexpected global leaders in the advancement of the personal and political rights of their LGBTQ and ally citizens. Through exposure to other cultures and intensive discussion on LGBTQ international experiences displayed throughout this course, students will improve their awareness and understanding of the political, economic, social, and cultural contexts through an LGBTQ developmental experience lens, using Brazil as a point of study. Students must apply for the course at sa.washu.edu.  There is a $1800 course fee for Brown School students. This will cover airfare, housing, in country transportation, breakfast, insurance.

In this course, the presentation development process will be emphasized, and students will focus on elements such as structure, organization of content, diction, visuals, delivery, and audience interaction. Class members will learn the assertion-evidence method of slide development, which emphasizes key messages and visual information, rather than traditional bullet points. To help students gain confidence, the class will begin with improvisational exercises, and over the course of the semester, each student will deliver at least three speeches, each with a different purpose. Through ongoing analysis and discussion of video presentations, guest speakers' talks, and their classmates' presentations - and through routine practice, peer feedback, and self-reflection, students will continue to strengthen their skills. Although the primary focus will be on technical topics for non-specialists, in one segment of the course, students will learn methods and strategies for leading effective problem-solving sessions.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENGR_316","school":"McKelvey School of Engineering","department":"Division of Engineering Education","title":"Reflective Writing in Medicine and Healthcare","catalogNumber":"ENGR 316","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ENGR_316_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Dahlheimer, Seema Mukhi"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[900,950],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ENGR_316_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Dahlheimer, Seema Mukhi"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[960,1010],"seats":[15,12]}]},"description":"Reflective writing is an essential step on the path to any career in medicine, public health, nursing, dentistry, or other healthcare fields.

In the past decades, electronic devices have been shrinking steadily to nanometer dimensions, and quantum transport has accordingly become increasingly important not only to physicists but also to electrical engineers. Traditionally, these topics are spread out over many physics/chemistry/engineering courses that take many semesters to cover. The main goal of this course is to condense the essential concepts into a one-semester course that is accessible to both senior-level undergraduate and junior-level graduate students. This course will be accessible to students with diverse backgrounds in electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, biomedical engineering, and mathematics.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ESE-E35_2971","school":"McKelvey School of Engineering","department":"Electrical & Systems Engineering","title":"Introduction to Research in ESE","catalogNumber":"ESE-E35 2971","units":2,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ESE-E35_2971_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Clark, Andrew"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ESE-E35_2971_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Yang, Lan"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,0]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ESE-E35_2971_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Sinopoli, Bruno"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[1,0]}]},"description":"This course provides students with an introductory experience with research in ESE. This is a mentored experience and requires the agreement of an ESE faculty member to serve in a mentorship role. Students must identify a mentor and obtain their agreement before registering for this course. Activities are to be designed by the student in conjunction with the faculty mentor, and will amount to 4-6 hours of commitment per week. The research activities will enable the student to gain a deeper understanding of ongoing research related to the mentor's field, or in an area mutually agreed upon by the mentor and the student. The student may also have an opportunity to actively participate in ongoing research activities, such as through assistance of graduate students or postdoctoral associates.

Properties of metallic materials are determined by their microstructure, which in turn is determined by their compositions and processing paths. An understanding of the multivariate relationships among compositions, processing parameters, microstructures, and properties is therefore essential to designing alloys and predicting their behavior in service. This course will discuss these relationships, with emphasis on the hierarchy of microstructural features, how they are achieved by processing, and how they interact to provide desirable property combinations -- essentially the physical metallurgy of alloys. The discussion will be based on examples from alloys used in airframes, engines, and automobiles and on their design for state-of-the-art processes such as additive manufacturing.

Software applications take on many forms such as web applications, mobile apps, and eCommerce sites, which are taken for granted by the users, business and consumers.  However, developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and scalable commercial software applications is a complicated task, which if not managed correctly, can result in significant financial losses and waste of time.  In this class students learn how to architect and design software taking into account business drivers and important attributes such as availability, performance, scalability, reliability, and security, and trade-offs between different design objectives.  We discuss various topics from software lifecycle management to integration of applications.  Contemporary topics like CI/CD pipelines, application containerization, serverless architecture are also discussed in detail.  Through class lectures, discussions, assignments, case studies, and group projects, students will build a solid understanding of application architectures and frameworks.

In particular, the course covers two fundamental and indispensable tools that form the backbone of all analytical approaches:  1.  Mathematical Optimization is the backbone of virtually all applied models with vast applications in engineering, business, statistics (including machine learning), computer science (including artificial intelligence), biology, medicine, etc. The critical step in modeling a practical problem is to express it in mathematical language. This enables us to use the computational power of computers to analyze the problem, extract insights, and devise implementable solutions. The course teaches this critical skill by carrying out this step for a large set of examples. The examples are carefully chosen to be both realistic and novel in at least one aspect. They are taken from various fields including operations management, marketing, finance, and machine learning.  2.  Statistical Simulation is a primary computational tool for modeling complex systems that exhibit random behavior (such as service time in a service system) or interact with random events (such as demand in a retail setting or price movement in a stock market). This course covers the basics of Monte Carlo simulation through examples and showcases its application in estimating relevant performance metrics and predicting a system's response to exogenous or endogenous changes. If time permits, select topics related to simulation-based optimization will also be discussed.  In addition to modeling and problem formulation, the course also covers problem implementation.

Experts estimate approximately that 90% of the data in organizations is in the form of unstructured datasets, including images, texts, customer reviews, videos, and so on. Organizations would like to use these datasets to improve their business. Moreover, deep learning has a significant advantage over other machine learning algorithms in that it does not require extracting features manually prior to applying algorithms. Leading-edge organizations are also expecting business analysts and managers to be familiar with applying deep learning models to solve business problems using unstructured data. This course is recommended but is not required for MS-Business Analytics (MSA) students. It will teach students to build deep learning models for solving business problems using Python libraries (e.g., Keras, Tensorflow). We will cover a range of algorithms from neural networks foundations to convolutional and recurrent network structures; these will be applied in domains such as marketing, customer behavior, and predicting finance risks. Students will better understand the practical use of deep learning with the use of the following five questions: (1) How can unstructured datasets be visualized and analyzed? (2) What are neural networks, and how can they be optimized? (3) What is the deep learning model, and how can it be used in business? (4) Which deep learning structure should be used for a given business problem? (5) How can a deep learning model be developed to solve business problems? In summary, the course will expose students to prevalent business applications of deep learning in different domains (e.g., customer analytics, supply chain analytics, healthcare analytics, financial technology analytics, accounting analytics, talent analytics). Upon completing this course, students will know how to build and optimize deep learning models for different business applications.

You will hear from entrepreneurs and corporate managers with an entrepreneurial flair, some who have experienced great success, and others for whom success has been elusive.  The structure of this course follows the evolutionary process of a new venture.  Topics covered include: Idea Assessment, Organization Formation, Capitalization, Growth, and Exit.

Analytical rigor will be emphasized throughout and you will be expected to have run the numbers for each case.

Most successful managers are able to incorporate and capitalize on the diversity of their employee population. However, by its nature, diversity means that we have different points of view, different values, different understandings and ways of knowing, different cultures and nationalities, and different ideas about how to measure and implement success and other factors in our organizations. Failure to incorporate and value those diverse voices can lead to conflict, negative press, turnover and poor performance in organizations and leave us paralyzed. Alternatively, we can capitalize on our diversity instead of letting it divide us. In so doing, we incorporate more points of view in our thought processes, consider novel alternatives, enhance creativity and performance, and incorporate all of our human assets by focusing on the basic values of equity, equality and inclusion. In this course, we will explore the impact of diverse organizational and multicultural contexts, with topics relevant to the workplace and our interactions, perceptions, and outcomes by exploring difference in terms of nationality, ethnicity, age, cultural values, gender differences, sexual orientation and different abilities. We take an interdisciplinary approach to the topic of diversity and inclusion. We will highlight diversity, equity and inclusion from the perspective of areas within business, law, and sociology. As we cover each topic area, we will juxtapose specific business practices and their impact (or lack thereof) on members of a diverse organization. We will also attend to the impact of different perspectives in terms of how business practices may be viewed by diverse employees, customers and stockholders. Our agenda will be accomplished in discipline-specific segments, where we examine a specific topic/business practice and its impact on various constituencies, identities and organizational outcomes. Students can expect discussions that at times involve conflicting ideas and positions. These discussions should be approached with humility and respect, and students should be courteous and professional.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_OB-B66_565","school":"Olin Business School","department":"","title":"Leading Change","catalogNumber":"OB-B66 565","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_OB-B66_565_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring Half A","instructor":["Danieli, Yoni"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[1095,1275],"seats":[51,0]}]},"description":"At work and throughout life, change happens.

Students will be introduced to various modeling software such as Rhino, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks and explore the potential of these platforms to design 3-dimensional forms. A variety of output tools will be used but we will focus primarily on the planning for and use of laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC routers. We will develop, design, and manufacture components that, when combined with readily available materials, can be used to create sculptural forms. This class will use iterative processes that move between digital and analog model-making and sketching. Students will be introduced to the concept of kitbashing, and the modification of salvaged and found parts. This course introduces these concepts to artists, designers, engineers, and anyone interested in exploring the possibilities of digital fabrication tools towards the creation of sculpture.

The course fulfills an Urban Design and Urban Issues elective for MUD, MArch & MLA degrees.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_212D","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Architectural Design II","catalogNumber":"ARCH 212D","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_212D_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Murphy, Kelley Van Dyck"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[12,65]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_212D_02_S","number":"02","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Abendroth, Ryan Michael"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_212D_03_S","number":"03","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Sanders, Melisa Angelein Betts"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_212D_04_S","number":"04","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Schump, Aaron Joseph"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_212D_05_S","number":"05","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Yin, Hongxi"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,1040],"seats":[12,12]}]},"description":"The second year of the core studio sequence examines interactions between architecture and technology through the design of a medium-scale project. Key concerns include transformative emerging technology, 8 cultural and material production, and labor practices in relation to digital tools and systems. This year emphasizes choice as students are supported in clarifying their conceptual position relative to architecture history, theory, and culture via the iterative development of form, geometry, space, and aesthetics. More specifically, this studio focuses on engagement with representation, technology, and circulation in a series of design projects that include: (1) a drawing device, (2) a fabrication analysis, and (3) a production and display space. Exercises explore problems of representation and mediation, architectural labor and automation, and mass and volume. Architectural Design II is the fourth in the series of the five required core studios in the undergraduate architecture program.

The class is organized around the themes of climate, site and energy.  The theme of climate addresses macro- and micro-climates, and the roles they have in developing architectural form through 'passive' strategies.

The outermost layer of the exterior wall is the most exposed to natural forces and therefore it needs careful attention as it must work effectively over the lifetime of the building. The primary goal of this fabrication seminar is the construction of full-scale mockup pieces that function as part of real building envelopes; this is an opportunity for hands-on experience. Students will design, develop and build enclosures out of different types of precast high-performance concrete assemblies as critical components of building envelopes. The course will be developed in partnership with Gate Precast, a leader company in the precast concrete industry. Supported by a grant from the PCI Foundation, students will have a budget of $12,500 to design and prototype precast mockups of building envelopes. Students will start by conducting research and analyzing historic and contemporary buildings, focusing on their skin properties and configurations. Then, they will proceed to identify specific environmental condition(s) and develop an enclosure as a response to such condition(s), advancing the design through detail drawings and study models, culminating in a full-scale mockup mold. Construction of the molds will be done at Washington University's facilities combining digital and analog methods of fabrication, including CNC milling, laser cutters, 3D printers, and vacuum-formed plastic, among other methods; a fully equipped wood shop is also available. Once the molds are finalized, they will be transported to Gate's architectural plant in Ashland City, TN, for reinforcing and concrete casting; this project will culminate in the demolding of full-scale precast mockup pieces.

The homogenization of global architectural values, under the guise of modernity, has undermined the cultural legacies that protected local and traditional building practices to the extent that many such practices are at risk of being lost forever. The Promiscuous Project utilizes generative AI's ability to disassociate from the imposed socio-political hierarchy of history to mine underexplored architectural qualities tied to cultural practices and hybridize them, drawing unexpected threads across time and space. In an increasingly mobile world, cultures are often practiced far from where they originate and are constantly evolving in response to their surroundings. This course seeks to parallel this cultural transgression in architectural production. This iteration of the seminar will focus on the cultural, architectural, and religious significance of domes in well-known Gothic churches like Notre Dame in France and lesser-known Persian and Ottoman mosques like the Shah Mosque in Iran. We will closely study their formal and ornamental qualities and speculate on how the hybrid domes are derivative of their origins while also deviating from them. We will explore virtual 3D scanning tools such as Trnio and RealityScan, AI processing tools like Google Colab, Automatic1111, and Adobe Firefly, and 3D modeling software like Rhinoceros, Blender, and ZBrush. The final deliverables will be a series of estranged physical objects that make productive the inevitable clash between diverse cultures and their spatial affinities.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_762","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Thesis","catalogNumber":"ARCH 762","units":6,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_762_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Mumford, Eric Paul"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,2]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_760","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Thesis Research","catalogNumber":"ARCH 760","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_760_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Mumford, Eric Paul"],"delivery":"Other Distance Mode","time":null,"seats":[0,1]}]},"description":"","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_216V","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Up-Cycles: Form, Function, and Design","catalogNumber":"ARCH 216V","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202502_ARCH_216V_01_S","number":"01","term":"2025 Spring","instructor":["Stouffer, Lindsey"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[510,680],"seats":[4,12]}]},"description":"This course explores the art and craft of bicycles.

But due to the infusion of political will and large amounts of money, they also involved the design and construction of enormous numbers of buildings all at once - resulting in the creation of small cities with their own infrastructure of utilities, waste disposal, police departments, hospitals and power plants.  The best architects and engineers of each era were called upon, sometimes in official competitions, to design and build innovative structures that expanded the use of materials and utilized engineering solutions which affected the built environment of the world.  The 1893 Chicago World's Fair alone changed the way Americans looked at cities and started the City Beautiful Movement.  Many architects designed influential pavilions at world's fairs, including Eliel Saarinen, Alvar Aalto, Oscar Niemeyer, Mies Van Der Rohe, Philip Johnson, Eero Saarinen, Frei Otto, Moshe Safdie, Kenzo Tange, Thomas Heatherwick, Norman Foster and Buckminster Fuller.  Today still-standing legacies of these fairs, including the Eiffel Tower, the Seattle Space Needle, the Montreal Biosphere, Habitat '67 and Zaha Hadid's Bridge Pavilion remind us of past glories.  World's Fairs are not relics of the past, but continue to be held today, involving architectural firms in master planning, pavilion design and exhibit creation on a massive scale.    Students will be expected to make short 10-15 minute presentations to the class on local sites at assigned times over the course of the term.
