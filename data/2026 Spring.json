Indeed, the vividness of the genre's greatest lyricist or the evocative tonnage of its greatest producers are often described as feeling like a movie. Over the past 50 years, this phrasing has proven to be both figurative and literal. From Spike Lee's resonant usage of Public Enemy's rebellious Fight the Power in Do The Right Thing to Hype William's haunting rendering of Nas's One Love in Belly, Hip-Hop has functioned as the soundtrack and aesthetic muse for nearly a half-century of Black film making. In the second half of this yearlong Ampersand course, students will build upon the cultural history established in the fall semester to explore how Hip-Hop-inspired, re-imagined, and soundtracked the world of film. Over the course of the semester, students will engage with a wide array of films, including documentaries, independent films, biopics, music videos, live performances, and various feature films. Films will be supplemented with traditional and multimedia sources within Hip-Hop Studies and Film and Media Studies, including articles, books, interviews, magazines, lyrics, and photography.

On the matter of race, African Americans who identify as conservatives tend to be strongly opposed to affirmative action, to distrust race-based public policy solutions and government intervention in race issues generally, to opposed to reparations for slavery, and to believe in character-building and values such as thrift and hard work as important virtues for Blacks to cultivate. Their hostility toward liberalism and leftist ideology is not quite the same as some religious-based Black conservatives, such as the racially militant Nation of Islam and the several black Pentecostal sects, who strenuously believe that white liberalism and white leftist thought are expressions of white decadence. However, their beliefs are not far removed from this. In this way, Black conservatives aBre seen in a harshly antagonistic way by the national lack political establishment, which is largely liberal, and by black intellectuals and scholars, who are, for the most part, leftist-leaning. The critics of Black conservatism cannot understand how some Black people can be attracted to ideas that are rooted in racist assumptions, that are justifications for white domination, and that have been used to defend the white-dominated status quo and a white, Eurocentric value system.  Race must be used as a weapon for liberation from white thralldom. What does a Black person have to conserve, and why would they want to identify with an ideology that has been used to oppress them? Black liberals and leftists call Black conservatives Uncle Toms and Sellouts. Black conservatives return the antagonism in full measure, arguing that white liberals and leftists use the victimology of Blacks as a cudgel  to beat whites with whom they politically disagree in order to effect the social change they desire and that they treat Blacks essentially as injured children who need to be either indulged, romanticized, excused, aided, or pitied. Racial identity is nothing more than a mere weapon of resentment. Black conservatives feel that Black liberals and leftists play into the hands of white liberals and leftists by making race an overdetermining factor in the lives of Black people. They also argue that the public policy solutions of Black liberals and leftists have not worked and that they in fact mostly benefit the Black middle class. They call civil rights leaders and Black liberal and leftist intellectuals race hustlers and race charlatans. The conflict here is not simply or solely political; it is also deeply psychological and a question of identity. What does being Black mean, and what is it prohibited from meaning? We will look closely at many of the major works of significant Black conservatives to understand the nature of their arguments and their claims to legitimacy. How do Black people see conservatism? What do they hope conservatism will do for the Black community? Have they made much of an inroad among Blacks?  Is it true, as some conservatives have claimed, that Blacks have a natural affinity for certain conservative ideas?

If poor health is the product of structural determinants, then intervention strategies and policies must move beyond individual-level messages and practices, and instead address the underlying factors that facilitate people’s vulnerability and shape their health-related behaviors and outcomes.  The course is designed to equip students with research and analytic skills from social sciences and history in critically examining the production of health inequities as they relate to intersecting issues of race/ethnicity and other axes of diversity and inequalities.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-61270","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"African and African-American Studies","title":"Race, Education & Inequality: From Segregation to Reform","catalogNumber":"AFAS 3201","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355271","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Smith, Monisola Vaughan"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[8,25]}]},"description":"In this course, we will examine how racial inequality shapes America’s schools and its impact on the educational experiences of Black youth.

Today, the provocations in Robinson’s work — the thinkers and activists who influenced it and those it influenced — offer insight into the interconnected crises of climate, politics, and capitalism while showing how the impact of these crises are unequally distributed across race, class, gender, and geographies. What is the relationship between race, labor, and the accumulation of capital? By what processes do the relational and chemical toxicity of environmental injustices get unequally distributed? Is capitalism inherently and always racial?

This course teaches students how to critically analyze U.S. culture and society and introduces them to the history, methodologies, frameworks, and key questions that have shaped and continue to inform this interdisciplinary field. American culture studies is a broad and vast discipline that defies simple summary; it asks probing questions to uplift marginalized voices and experiences as part of an expansive definition of American identity. This course exposes students to practices that constitute American culture studies rather than demarcate a terrain for what it is: historically crossing disciplinary boundaries (arts, humanities, social sciences) and engaging diverse texts (film, literature, historical documents, popular culture, performance, material culture, etc.) American culture studies resists strict definition!  In this course students study how knowledge and understandings about society and culture are produced and learn approaches to analyzing, curating and interpreting cultural objects and theorizing cultural phenomena. We examine the concept and idea of America in local, regional, national, and international contexts and continuums; we explore the lived experiences of diverse American communities within and across cultural and literal borders.  Through a case study approach, the course engages questions related to the construction of ethnic and racial identities in the U.S.; visual, material, and digital cultures; social thought and social issues; mass media and popular culture; gender and sexuality; citizenship and nationhood; art, literature, and performance; and American imperialism.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_645","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Introduction to American Culture Studies","catalogNumber":"AMCS 6000","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355003","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Sheren, Ila Nicole"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[4,5]}]},"description":"An introduction to interdisciplinary approaches to the study of American culture.

His work reflects the emergent concerns of citizen surveillance in Western democracies and the techno-logics of 21st-century political reality, where persistent monitoring, invisible identification, and data collection are features of both government control and data-driven capitalism. The rise in technological sophistication in both the capture and assessment of data makes adoption at scale by city governments affordable and relatively noncontroversial. But as the surveillance of bodies, habits, associations, and identities becomes more naturalized in the governing and policing institutions of urban areas, legal safeguards lag behind, concepts like privacy and security become fuzzier, and existing inequalities of race and class become hardcoded in the techno-systems supposedly designed as neutral tools. This fieldwork class will explore St. Louis as a landscape of the always observed, from community-level realities to online experiences. Readings and class discussions will be complemented by field trips to sites in the St. Louis region to interrogate the practice of observation in situ among different zip codes and communities where the blanketing presence of surveillance practices and surveillance technology warps a relationship to place; amplifies racial, cultural, and class inequalities and disenfranchisements; consolidates social and political control; and replaces human accountability with the veneer of the objective and rational machine.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_AMCS_330","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"American Culture Studies","title":"Topics in AMCS","catalogNumber":"AMCS 3707","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_AMCS_330_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Maciak, Phillip Jon"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":null}]},"description":"This topic varies by semester.

Gateway to the West. A city of neighborhoods. One of the most segregated places in America. A sports town with the best fans in the world. The heart of the Silicon Prairie. Flyover country. St. Louis has been called all of these things and many more over the past 200 years. Like all cities, its evolving identity has been shaped by stories, ideas, place memories, and local branding efforts that are deeply rooted in the visual imagination -- those pictures of the mind that define a distinct sense of place. Such pictures are at once personal and shared. And some -- like aerial photos of the Arch -- become definitive elements of the visual imaginary and are reproduced endlessly, from art galleries to tourist maps to baseball caps. This introductory course explores the visual culture of the American city, seeking to understand its powerful political and social significance at key moments in urban history. We will engage the rich archives of urban life, culture, and economic development associated with Chicago, New York, St. Louis, Detroit, and other cities, working with maps, engravings, photographs, travel guides, souvenirs, billboards, posters, and many other visual technologies, including digital representations and experimental formats. In so doing, we will attend to various historical phenomena, from world's fairs and urban renewal projects to catastrophic violence and slum clearance to gentrification and social reform -- and their visual representations -- that have shaped these cities' public lives and identities and contributed to broader urban imaginaries that are still powerfully present today.

settler colonialism. We trace connections between U.S. domestic policy and imperialist ideologies, politics, and violent war from the United States to the Philippines to Latin America and the Middle East. By reading work by Native American and non-Native scholars, writers, and activists, we will consider how issues of race, class, gender and sexuality, violence, policing and militarism, nature, education, language, and sovereignty are intertwined with coloniality, forms of anti-colonial resistance, and the making of decolonized futures. Readings will be interdisciplinary, drawing on anthropology, history, politics, and literature. Students will develop research projects through case studies of their choosing.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_142","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Ampersand: Medicine and Society","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 1142","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ANTHRO_142_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Jones, AJ"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[23,25]}]},"description":"This course is the required second-semester sequence of the introduction to medical anthropology and cultural anthropology for students enrolled in the Medicine and Society program.

Topical areas include analyses of disease, illness and sickness at micro and macro levels; the impact of personal and interpersonal factors on health; the health effects of social, political, and economic factors; the relationship of anthropology to biological and social sciences approaches; the ecology of health and development; and cross-cultural health studies of language, gender, and race/ethnicity.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_452","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Applied Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4522","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-354455","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ampadu, Felix"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[0,20]}]},"description":"This course explores the field of applied anthropology and its approach to understanding human social problems. The focus is on the qualitative and quantitative information applied anthropologists use to study practical human social problems. We will examine the four important factors that influence the practical application of theories and methods to social problems: (1) the specific challenges faced by individuals with particular social identities; (2) the coping strategies developed by local groups and the sustainability of their efforts; (3) the interests and objectives of key actors involved; and (4) the goals, identities, and ethics of researchers. Taking a comparative perspective, the course employs an ethnographic, historical, and geographic approach to understand local problems within global contexts. Students will engage in research projects applying anthropological concepts and methods, thereby scrutinizing the contexts in which information is collected, analyzed, disseminated, and utilized by applied anthropologists.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_4314","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Archaeology of St. Louis","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4314","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-353261","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Olson, Kyle Gregory"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[19,20]}]},"description":"The Archaeology of St. Louis offers a comprehensive exploration of the rich history and cultural heritage of St. Louis from an archaeological perspective. We will take a deep dive into the archaeological record of the city and its surroundings, beginning from the earliest human occupation of the land that is now St. Louis all the way up to the present. We will consult a range of archaeological, historical, and artistic sources to uncover the city's past, extending from the lifeways of St. Louis' original Indigenous inhabitants to its time as the capital of Upper Louisiana, to its role as the administrative center of Westward expansion during early American Republic, to its hey-day as one of the United States' largest and wealthiest industrial cities, before its subsequent decline and renewal. The course will examine archaeological sites, artifacts, maps, and documents that contribute to our understanding of the city's past and how its history resonates in the present.  This course is primarily a reading- and discussion-focused course, with occasional lectures, guest speakers, museum visits, and fieldtrips to local archaeological and historical sites. Overall, this course aims to provide students with an appreciation for the rich layers of history, material culture, and heritage in St. Louis and a greater knowledge of its Indigenous, European, and Black cultural histories.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_434","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Behavioral Research At the St. Louis Zoo","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 4340","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ANTHRO_434_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Milich, Krista Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[540,710],"seats":[5,12]}]},"description":"Students conduct research at the St. Louis Zoo.

We will examine cultural attitudes toward death and how the denial and awareness of human mortality can shape social practices and institutions. Finally, we will consider issues regarding quality of life, the opportunities and challenges of caregiving, and hospice traditions around the world. This course will include readings and films about individuals and groups, both in the United States and around the world, as well as guest speakers (hospice workers, home aides, organ donation facilitators, counselors) who will talk about issues related to end-of-life health and caretaking issues in and around St Louis.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ANTHRO_508","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Anthropology","title":"Selected Topics in Physical Anthropology","catalogNumber":"ANTHRO 5088","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-354504","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Patania, Ilaria"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[2,10]}]},"description":"Topics will be selected from current controversies or research in the fields of human or primate biology.

Ethnographic field studies designed with archaeological problems in mind have become more common, and have contributed substantially to archaeological interpretation. Questions such as how archaeological sites form, and interpretation of changing human diets, human adaptations to challenging environments, how people domesticated plants and animals, the nature of human foodways, gender roles, the spread of food production or ritual and burial practices have all been informed by ethnoarchaeological studies  We will look at ethnoarcheological approaches to the interpretation of many different categories of archeological data including: lithics, ceramics, house structures, and rock art and discuss a wide variety of archaeological topics to which ethnoarchaeological approaches have been applied.

Europe, the Americas, and across the globe, from the mid-19th century to the present. Focus will be on the history and theories of modernism and its international legacies as well as the relationship of the visual arts, architecture and visual culture more generally to the social, cultural and political contexts of the modern era. Although the precise topics covered may vary from one instructor to another, foundational movements and trends to be discussed will typically include the Beaux-Arts style, the Arts and Crafts Movement, Impressionism, Symbolism, Art Nouveau, Cubism, Dada, Surrealism, Purism, Art Deco, the Bauhaus, the International Style, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism and Post-Modernism. Cross-currents in various media will be emphasized as we seek to understand the origins and complexity of modern visual forms in relation to political and cultural history and to critical theory. Students will engage a wide range of readings in historical sources; theories composed by artists, architects and designers; critical responses to the arts; and secondary critical literature.

This seminar will study a series of charged moments in the production and consumption of printed artefacts, attending to the aesthetic, material, and epistemological significance of printed images between roughly 1480 and 1650.

Morgan at Columbia and R.A. Emerson at Cornell, and led to the expansion of classical genetics up to World War II. The beginnings of biochemical and molecular genetics in the 1920s and 1930s developed rapidly after the war with the double-helix theory of DNA and the rise of molecular genetics. The course ends with examination of the Human Genome Project (Initiative) and the ramifications of genetic biotechnology. Throughout, emphasis is placed not only on the technical and theoretical developments comprising genetics as an epistemic field, but also on the economic, social, political and philosophical interconnections between genetics and society. Agriculture, medicine and the ideology of social control (including such movements as eugenics and Nazi race hygiene) both influenced, and were influenced by genetics, and played an integral part in the construction of the science itself.

In the dynamic era of genomics, the field of forward genetics offers a powerful approach to uncovering the genetic basis of phenotypic variation across a wide array of organisms. Next-Gen Genetics is a cutting-edge upper-level laboratory course that bridges traditional genetic analysis with modern genomic techniques. The course emphasizes the universality and applicability of forward genetics methods in various research systems including animals, plants, and microbes. In this course we will use plants as a model system to explore forward genetic approaches. Through a blend of engaging lectures, interactive bioinformatics labs, and hands-on greenhouse and wet lab sessions, students will journey from the fundamentals of genetic variation and trait inheritance to the forefront of genomic technology. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with bioinformatics tools, participants will experience the thrill of discovery by identifying new trait loci associated with phenotypic traits in a novel research project. This course is an invitation to explore the genetic complexities of living organisms in the genomic age. Whether you're aiming to revolutionize plant breeding, uncover the genetic underpinnings of disease in humans, or explore the vast diversity of microbial life, Next-Gen Genetics offers the tools and insights to propel your scientific journey. By the end of this course, students will have designed and carried out an experiment, phenotyped a segregating population of tomato plants, extracted DNA and sent it to be sequenced. Students will then analyze genomic sequences and perform their own Bulk Segregant Analysis experiment to identify genetic loci associated with chosen phenotypes.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_BIOL_2658","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Biology","title":"Pediatric Emergency Medicine Research Associates Program - Experiences in Life Sciences (PEMRAP II)","catalogNumber":"BIOL 2968","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-361770","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Gravatte, Crystal Jean","Hoganson, George Michael","Dickey, Viani Pinon"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[20,15]}]},"description":"PEMRAP II is a continuation of PEMRAP I.

Chemistry has played a vital role in providing the energy needs of society, and advances in chemistry can help to develop abundant and economically viable energy technologies that do not have adverse consequences on the environment. Chemistry has long been central to the use of fossil fuel, and there remain opportunities to improve the efficiency of fossil energy resources, thereby contributing to lower carbon dioxide emission per unit of energy generated. Chemistry is critical to the development of renewable energy resources, especially solar energy for the generation of electricity and fuels. Material covered will include the challenges associated with meeting the world's increasing energy needs while reducing the emission of carbon dioxide. This class will cover the role of chemistry in energy technologies, including the storage of energy.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CHEM_181","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Chemistry","title":"First-Year Opportunity: Why is Chemistry Called The Central Science?","catalogNumber":"CHEM 1101","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-352450","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hayes, Sophia E."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[6,25]}]},"description":"In this course, we seek to answer that question by showing how chemistry is a thread that runs through many disciplines, including biology, physics, astronomy, geology, medicine and environmental science. We will learn about the many types of chemistry-oriented research that are conducted at WashU, along with presentations by several chemists who have gone on to use their chemistry degree in industry or in other adjacent fields.  This is a terrific way to gain exposure about how to prepare your own academic pathway through many diverse fields, through using chemistry as a platform.  In this first year opportunity seminar style course, we rely on active dialogue in the classroom, through questions and discussion.  You can expect to learn about science communication tools and gain some practice with translating difficult science concepts to a broader audience.  This will include short written assignments, but also can include graphical depictions of information and data (tools that may be understood well for science outreach or for professional uses of social media.)","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CHEM_290","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Chemistry","title":"First-Year Research","catalogNumber":"CHEM 1900","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Berkland, Cory"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Birman, Vladimir B"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_05_S","number":"05","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Gross, Michael L"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_06_S","number":"06","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hayes, Sophia E."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_07_S","number":"07","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Heemstra, Jen"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_08_S","number":"08","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hutchison, Brandon"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_09_S","number":"09","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Jackrel, Meredith E"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_10_S","number":"10","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ke, Chenfeng"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_11_S","number":"11","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Loomis, Richard A."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_12_S","number":"12","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Mabbs, Richard"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[3,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_13_S","number":"13","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Moeller, Kevin D."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_14_S","number":"14","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Okuno, Yusuke"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_15_S","number":"15","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Patti, Gary J"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_16_S","number":"16","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ponder, Jay William"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_17_S","number":"17","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Powderly, Kelly"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_18_S","number":"18","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Reichhardt, Courtney R"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_19_S","number":"19","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Sadtler, Bryce"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_20_S","number":"20","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Sobotka, Lee G."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_21_S","number":"21","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Taylor, John-Stephen A."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_23_S","number":"23","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Wencewicz, Timothy A"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_24_S","number":"24","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Wexler, Robert Bruce"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CHEM_290_25_S","number":"25","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Yu, Yan"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,20]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-352564","number":"26","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Zheng, Zach"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,20]}]},"description":"This course presents an introduction to research for first- and second-year students.

The third major focus is interpretation of EI and product-ion spectra from MS/MS. Mechanisms of gas-phase ion decomposition reactions, rates and thermodynamics of gas-phase ion processes, and ion-molecule reactions are discussed in terms of interpreting spectra. A major emphasis is the spectra of peptides and proteins, providing a basis for the field of proteomics and related omics areas. The fourth focus is the fundamentals of instrumentation design and implementation: quadrupole, time-of-flight, ion trap, orbitraps, and Fourier transform instruments. Combined or hyphenated GC/MS, LC/MS, and tandem mass spectrometry are also discussed.  Applications in a variety of areas are worked in as the course progresses:  structure determination of synthetic, natural products, metabolites, and biomolecules, exact mass measurements (high resolution MS), peptide and protein and other biomolecule sequencing, sensitive detection, trace analysis, and mixture analysis.

This First Year Seminar, which requires no prior knowledge of Roman history or the Latin language, explores the political, military, and social changes experienced during Rome’s transition from republic to principate(empire) during the second half of the first century BCE. The first third of the course will introduce students to the necessary historical background for this tumultuous period and to relevant topics inRoman political and social life. After this introduction, students will engage directly with the Second Triumviral period through a roleplay game (Memento Romane Regere) designed to simulate the decisions faced by individual Romans and important Roman allies during this period. In the process of developing their characters’ political, military, and social careers, students will investigate the followingquestions: was Rome’s transition from cooperative to autocratic government inevitable; how did Roman social, military, and political systems interact; what was the role that personal relationships played in determining political outcomes; how did Romans negotiate political and social differences; and finally, how were the experiences of living through this difficult time period determined by an individual’s identity?

Students will read a wide selection of poems in the main types of epigram: funerary, dedicatory, erotic, and epideictic, and consider questions of authorship attribution. In particular, we will study the organization of collections, both using papyrological evidence (i.e. the new Posidippus discovery) to think about the artistic decisions behind ancient collections and also using the textual tradition to investigate how late antique and Byzantine collections have shaped our knowledge of the genre.

Even when presented as kitschy or campy, these forces of horror move us,act on us, and compel us toward an acknowledgement of what we are—or, perhaps, arealization of what we are not.Through methods of cultural analysis, we will examine how constructions of hell andmonstrosity function as archetypes that hold powerful social and political implications inthe contemporary United States. We will explore how these constructions can bothreinforce and trouble the boundaries between “self” and “other,” operating as forces ofdiscipline as well as disruption. Ultimately, we will consider: How is the “human” createdand undone in the presence of the monster, and how might a critical engagement withhorror invite us to creatively reimagine our horizons of political and relational possibility?Throughout the semester, we will engage scholarly texts in feminist theory, queer studies,religious studies, and American studies—alongside film, literature, news media,hagiography, and art—as resources and conversation partners.

It’s a pleasure having a writer openup to you, share secrets, admit failures, celebrate triumphs, and tell how they came tobe who they are. The pleasure is the writer’s, too. How many of us have, in effect,written our own memoirs, bit by bit, in diaries, emails, or social-media stories?A sub-genre has emerged, spiritual memoir. Spiritual memoirs on the writer’srelationship to invisible worlds: spirit, religion, mysticism, the numinous, the divine.They may tell stories of conversion; of loss of faith; of inexplicable encounters withspiritual forces; of heightened experience (maybe heightened by drugs, fasting,meditation, other aids); of joining a community centered on a relationship to the divine.In this course, we read spiritual memoirs for insight into the psychology, andsometimes, physiology, of spiritual change; to learn about religions; to see how spirituallife fits into culture; to understand how spiritual identity relates to, complements, or isin tension with other identities (racial, sexual, political, class, etc.); and to understandliterary techniques that make a piece of writing effective or good.But mostly for pleasure.

These questions are complicated by the fact that we often see our vulnerabilities mostvividly when they have been realized in wounds, and so the conversation proceeds fromsituations of trauma, mourning, and the immediate needs of caregiving and recovery. Do theseoccasions aid the discussion, or obscure it?

How might your taste in potato chips relate to your choice in winter coat? How does writing itself contribute to larger cultural conversations? This course will explore how our choices as consumers, creators, and writers are mediated by broader cultural forces such as foodways, fashion, music, advertisement, art, and social media. \"Commodity culture\" refers to what aspects of culture can be evaluated in terms of supposed \"worth\" or economic value. Here students will think critically, draft, take risks, and revise to present work that has been elevated to college-level writing and argumentation. Readings will explore a range of rigorous scholarship and multimedia texts -- whether it's the importance of cultural capital in college admissions, the role of social media in the rise of self-branding, recognizing accessibility in our known environment, Taylor Swift’s connection to “rainbow capitalism,” or the blurred line between high art and  Instagram. As avid readers and writers, we will delve into the details of rhetorical context to approach both published media and our own essays as instances of cultural production. No prior knowledge of foodways, art history, or media studies is necessary for this course, but students are expected to develop a nuanced appreciation of how something as seemingly innocuous as cultural output intersects with larger structures of status, power, and social justice. THIS COURSE SATISFIES THE FIRST-YEAR WRITING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DIVISIONS.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_CWP_118","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"College Writing Program","title":"College Writing: Technology & Selfhood","catalogNumber":"CWP 1508","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[720,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[780,830],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Boese, Stefanie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[840,890],"seats":[6,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_04_S","number":"04","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_05_S","number":"05","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[12,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_06_S","number":"06","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Henderson, Rin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[11,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_08_S","number":"07","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Waters, Aileen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[10,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_09_S","number":"08","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Waters, Aileen"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[11,12]},{"id":"SEC_202602_CWP_118_07_S","number":"10","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Iler, Dustin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[12,12]}]},"description":"Writing is a technology that allows one to read the thoughts of others across space and time. Our course's theme -- technology -- is the subject matter that we will be reading to hone skills such as analysis, argumentation, and critical thinking. This does not mean that a student must be a budding technologist to succeed in this course, nor will this course seek to transform a student into one. Rather, this course treats technology in its broadest sense, from its root in the Greek techne (which means craftsmanship, craft, art, or rhetoric) to its contemporary definition as the realm of knowledge that deals with the mechanical arts and applied sciences. In writing about technology, we will consider perspectives across the university curriculum in order to better comprehend our relationship with our tools and to scrutinize the dynamic interaction, communication, and interdependence of different kinds of tools for various means of communication and representation. We will strive to think critically about ourselves as part of larger communities and systems by attending closely to the ways we communicate with and about others through technologies such as writing, film, and social media. In writing creative, analytical, argumentative, and researched essays, we will address responsible uses of technology and the effects that technologies have on different communities and individuals, and we will try to answer questions like the following: How does technology affect us when we use it? How do technologies intersect and affect one another? What roles does technology play in our everyday lives? What roles do we want it to play in our future?

And yet hoaxes have been around longer than the internet, and often do work beyond the realm of the political.  Kevin Young writes in Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbugs, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts and Fake News that the hoax is suited to America in a way that other places can only aspire to, with our fake-it-til-you-make-it hucksterism a kind of national ethos. In this course we look at a wealth of hoaxes, from those in art, which are often designed to shake our faith in institutions telling us what is valuable and to ask us to think for ourselves, to those of the newspaper wars of the 1800s, when outrageous scoops about the creatures who live on the moon helped sell papers to readers who were invited to enjoy, if not quite believe, the news.  We will examine what we can learn from these historical and contemporary apolitical hoaxes, and how that knowledge can be brought to bear on those we see today, where hoaxes can fray trust in public institutions like the press, the government, and even the university.

It sets off a former world of assignably “traditional” values and introduces a number of recognizably “modern” phenomena—of “world” war, since almost all the European nation states (and their colonial populations) were plunged into the conflict; of “total” war, where all the economic, cultural, and human resources of each nation state were mobilized for the military effort; and of “atrocity” as a commonplace of experience, where the weaponry invented for the dimensions of mass warfare produced an indiscriminate “overkill” as a routine feature of strategy.We approach the broad European import of the war in this course by reading its national literatures comparatively. Moving beyond the motivated interests of any one country, we will be working to discern the points of overlapping emphases and contrasting values in the literary record of the major nationalprotagonists: Great Britain, Germany (and Austria), and France. While original language editions of these literary works are available, all our working texts will come in English translation. It will feature the landmark works of English poets and novelists Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon and Rebecca West, German and Austrian and Czech writers like Joseph Roth and Ernst Jünger and Franz Kafka, and French literary greats like Guillaume Apollinaire and Jean Cocteau.Our readings move through three major phases. We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry and contemporary combat narratives (1914-1919), develop into the more constructed stories of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war. In the narrative of literary history, we will see the forms and genres of literature undergoing a transformational change, where, say, the pastoral circumstance of turn-of-the-century verse gives way to the lyric realism of an identifiably “new” poetry, and the end-oriented narratives of character development in Victorian novels change to a pattern of time in which the future has disappeared. This is the literature of history, and it provides the most vivid and intense record of this watershed event in western modernity.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_IPH_203C","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Comparative Literature and Thought","title":"Early Political Thought: Text & Traditions","catalogNumber":"COMPLITTHT 2108","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-351207","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Gais, Amy L."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[18,19]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-351233","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Keeline, Thomas"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":null}]},"description":"A selected survey of the political and moral thought of Europe from the rise of Athenian democracy to the Renaissance, with emphasis on analysis and discussion of writers such as Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Castiglione, and Machiavelli.

We will begin our exploration of the concept of translation as a key mechanism of transmission between different languages by looking at works of literature, and film. Students will then examine how different cultures have historically required translation in their encounter with each other, studying how translation constitutes a necessary transcultural bridge both from a colonial and postcolonial point of view in different historical moments and parts of the world. The course also analyzes from practical and real-world perspectives whether concepts such as war, human rights, democracy or various illnesses have the same meaning in different societies by considering the diverse frames of reference used by linguists, lawyers, anthropologists, and medical doctors across the world. Finally, we will focus on translation from a technological perspective by examining various modes of transfer of information required for the functioning of digital tools such as Google Translate, Twitter, Duolingo, or various Iphone applications. Throughout the semester we will also examine a range of creative artworks, and various forms of digital technology and computing (AI, machine translation) related to the theory and practice of translation.

This course takes students on a journey of wonder and discovery, uncovering the profound transhistorical and transmedia resonances by exploring what we call \"strange tales\" in premodern China, from the Six Dynasties to the Qing dynasty (4th-18th centuries). But what makes these tales truly \"strange\"? Moving beyond traditional supernatural creatures such as ghosts and fox spirits, strangeness operates as a powerful storytelling tool for creating alternative realities that transcend human limitations-inventing parallel worlds, bending time and space, crafting adventures, offering solutions to social problems, and expanding ways of knowing and perceiving. Drawing on literature, media, and game studies, students will develop critical analytical skills to unpack how these tales complicate and question the boundaries between self and other, illusion and reality, knowledge and belief-gaining fresh insights into their pioneering world­ building techniques, interactive strategies, and continuing influence on our digital lives. Students will also have the opportunity to complete a research-based transmedia storytelling project that reimagines a strange tale through a contemporary lens, reinventing it for a different medium such as a game, an interactive fiction, or a short video.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-62052","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"East Asian Languages and Cultures","title":"Chinese Undergraduate Teaching Assistants","catalogNumber":"CHINA 2900","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355253","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Liang, Xia"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[6,10]}]},"description":"In this course undergraduate students with native or near native proficiency in Chinese assist in the first, second, and third level modern Chinese language classes by serving as one-on-one session tutor, lab drill and practice session tutor, or discussion leader under close supervision of the faculty.

Market power can be a source of market incompleteness. As a consequence, market power directly affects financial products brought to the market. Thus, misallocation can arise due to market power. We will start the course with properly introducing the concept of market power and various ways of measuring it.

There are too many theories, though, and most of them have little to do with anything we have ever observed in human history. Some theories are elegant and parsimonious, even beautiful, but they belong to the science fiction section: they talk about the economic growth that could have possibly happened on some planet, but did not happen on ours. One should learn about their existence, and make a memo to never again walk along those paths to try understanding economic growth on planet Earth. Other theories, e.g. those assuming exogenous growth, are really not theories but useful accounting frameworks from where one should start asking the modeling questions. The course is structured along a history of economic thought line: it begins with the classical economists (Ricardo, Malthus and Marx)  as they had theories about the necessary absence of economic growth in the long run, and it ends with the current theories about increasing returns, widespread externalities and the weightless economy. The approach is fairly rigorous, but it assumes that participants read the original articles/books and go through the proofs themselves. As we go along we try to separate good theories from bad theories and, more important, we try to separate theories from models, the latter being theories that have some qualitative and quantitative consistency with observed facts.  It is models, at the end, that we want to learn about.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ECON_452","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Economics","title":"Industrial Organization","catalogNumber":"ECON 4335","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-352760","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Rivers, David Alan"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[34,40]}]},"description":"Theoretical and empirical analysis of the presence and value of competitive forces in the United States economy.

Ultimately, students will become more able to articulate their reasoned perspectives as emerging professionals regarding best practices for meaningful teaching and learning in school settings.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_EDUC_4841","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Education","title":"Elementary Methods Field Experience","catalogNumber":"EDUC 4580","units":2,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_EDUC_4841_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Fair, Kerri Lynn"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Thu"],"time":[810,920],"seats":[2,10]}]},"description":"This course involves the application and analysis of specific content area methods and strategies in an elementary school classroom.

In this course, which will be conducted as a discussion-based seminar, we will engage with texts examining the enterprise of education from varied vantage points, but always through a sociological lens. We'll discuss the varied purposes theorists and practitioners envision for schools, and the extent to which schools live up to those ideals. We'll talk at length about how schools are a microcosm of many of the inequalities we see in the broader society, looking at issues of race, class, gender, and place. By taking a sociological lens to studying education, we'll learn a language and facility for rooting discussion of issues in education in theoretical grounding and empirical evidence.

The movie wasn't faithful to the book. The TV series didn't capture the book like the movie did. These have forever been the complaints of readers watching their favorite works of literature adapted to the screen, and, in a media ecosystem increasingly flooded with adaptations and reboots of existing intellectual property, these complaints won't be going away any time soon. Film and literature have been interconnected since the very first films screened at end of the nineteenth century, but the dynamic between literature and media has sometimes been strained: film reviled as the cheap degradation of a vital art form, the novel anxious at the rise of narrative film - and later television - as rival storytelling media. But, viewing literature and visual media in opposition can obscure what becomes visible if we view them together. This is a course about the history, theory, and practice of adaptation from literature to film and television and back again rooted in both canonical and non-canonical case studies. We will study authors whose works have been repeatedly adapted across eras and media; filmmakers whose works are pastiches of various literary and cinematic sources; rigorously, obsessively faithful adaptations; radically transformative unfaithful adaptations; and works of literature and media that are themselves about the process and ethics of adaptation. The course will be anchored by a reading of Emily St. John Mandel's 2014 novel Station Eleven and a serial viewing - replicating the unusual original release - of HBO Max's miniseries adaptation.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_421","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Advanced Fiction Writing","catalogNumber":"WRITING 4200","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_WRITING_421_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Klimasewiski, Marshall N"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":null}]},"description":"For qualified students who wish to continue their creative writing and reading through immersion in an intensive fiction workshop.

We will begin with definitions of editing in the publishing world, but move quickly to focus on the practice of editing for grammar, syntax, and mechanics. While learning the conventions for edited prose suggested by the Chicago Manual of Style, we will note how arbitrary those conventions are by looking at other systems (e.g., MLA, APA, AMA) next to Chicago's. Two exams will assess what students have learned about editorial practice, including citation of source, as well as grammar, syntax, and style. Three written projects will ask students to do their most careful work in editing, analysis, and revision. The final project, with presentation, will ask students to learn about fact checking.

In this course, we will examine, from a writerly perspective, the nature of that divide. Is it merited? Are science fiction and fantasy stories so fundamentally different in their construction from their conventional counterparts as to require a radically different approach, and if so, what unique devices do writers of imaginative fiction employ to set their stories apart? Our guide in this exploration will be Jeff Vandermeer's Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction, which we will be considering not just as an instruction manual, but as a representative text. How does Wonderbook -- in its content, construction, and conceit -- differ from more standard writing reference books? How is it similar? In what ways does Vandermeer's guide embody its subject matter? To aid us in this examination, we will be considering contemporary science fiction and fantasy stories by writers on both sides of the genre fence. The purpose of our reading is generative as well as illustrative. We seek to employ what we learn. There will be multiple writing exercises building towards a ten-to-twenty-page science fiction or fantasy story. As a final project, students will submit their collected writings as part of their own Wonderbook.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_300","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 3999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_300_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Loewenstein, Joseph"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]}]},"description":"This course is for independent study in English Literature.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"ELIT 5999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Brown, J Dillon"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]},{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Fleming, Julius B."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]},{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_500_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Schaberg, Christopher"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[2,2]},{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_500_05_S","number":"05","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Fleming, Julius B."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]}]},"description":"A detailed prospectus approved by a faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student's work must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_WRITING_500","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"WRITING 5999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_WRITING_500_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Davis, Kathryn"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[2,2]},{"id":"SEC_202602_WRITING_500_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Klimasewiski, Marshall N"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]},{"id":"SEC_202602_WRITING_500_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Eburne, Jonathan Paul"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[1,1]}]},"description":"Independent study in creative or expository writing.

That novel eventually established Robinson at the Iowa Writers Workshop where she taught for many years. What many noticed in her first book was a new sort of voice, a lyric prose, which returned over two decades later in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel \"Gilead\" (2004). Since then, she has written two more novels (\"Home\" and \"Lila\") set in the same town, but with radically different voices and perspectives. Between these novels and her collected essays, Robinson's work engages issues of race, gender, history, regionalism, and religion. Her later work has focused in particular on the role of the humanities and higher education. She has been a lecturer in high demand (appearing at Wash U in November 2018), and she has been interviewed many times-most noticeably by Barack Obama for \"The New York Review of Books.\" In this class, we will read all her published books, asking questions of development, style, and voice. Meanwhile, as we see what critical engagements have been made with her writings, we will situate her within broader academic discourses (like feminist studies, critical race theory, or religion and literature), and ask how various approaches can open new insights into her writings.

Through their lives and work, we explore contrasting cultures of colonialism in early America. Both were religious, both were brilliant, and both wrote into and out of imperial experiences in very different settings (New England and New Spain). Anne Bradstreet published the first American book of poetry in English (1650), and she has been a mainstay of American literature ever since. The class will focus on studies of gender and religion in her writings, understanding her work more fully with studies of puritanism and English settler colonialism. For broader context and understanding of colonial writings, the course moves from Anne Bradstreet to the life and writings of the Mexican poet, intellectual, and cloistered nun, Sor Juana. We will study her poetry, her dramatic works, as well as her autobiographical and other writings. Special emphasis will be given to the colonial society in which she lived and the impact it had on her intellectual production. We will examine seventeenth-century Mexican convent culture and its role within the Church hierarchy as well as how her gender inflected her writing, using this as a backdrop from which to study Sor Juana's polemical relationship with the ecclesiastical authorities. Together, the course will introduce broader understandings of colonialism through the comparison of these two poets, their works, and the very different early American contexts that gave shape to their lives and writings.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ELIT_519","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"English","title":"Seminar: The 19th Century","catalogNumber":"ELIT 5612","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ELIT_519_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["McKelvy, William R"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[3,15]}]},"description":"This class begins with two seminal Modernist portraits of the artist, one a writer, the other a painter (Joyce's \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" and Woolf's \"To the Lighthouse\"), and then returns to a more detailed reading of a fifty-year period from the 1840s to 1890s to ask how artists of all kinds became prominent characters in literary works.

Students may use specific translations (Heaney's \"Beowulf,\" Tolkien's and Armitage's \"Gawain,\" Donaldson's \"Piers\") but are encouraged to become familiar with the original language, style and sound of these poems. We shall study alliterative poetry historically as well as critically: who wrote it, and who read it? Why was it revived in later medieval England, and from what sources? Given the quality of the later works, why did the form apparently die out? Did it really do so, or was its future history in poetry and prose masked by linguistic and cultural change, and by later scholarly misunderstanding? We shall think about historical memory and archive, reading communities and literary culture/s.

Yet while writers and artists set out with a purpose-a clear vision and intention-those motives may change or evolve throughout the creative process.

Initially, Leibovitz had a clear vision and mission in mind; she conceived of the photo as a moment of stolen intimacy: \"a simple kiss in a jaded time.\" But everything changed in an instant-in the blink of an eye. That night, Lennon was shot and killed while returning to the Dakota. In retrospect, recounts Leibovitz, the portrait \"looks like a last kiss.\" This is a course about stories and storytelling. What stories do we tell and what stories are we told?? How does art (written, visual, and performative) enable us to share our experiences-to bring purpose and meaning to our lives and to the lives of others? Throughout this course, we will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a broad range of discourse communities, including (but not limited to) art history, sociology, psychology, film studies, and cultural studies.

Like many urban areas, the St. Louis region faces egregious social, environmental and health disparities. In this course, we critically examine the role of racism and other structural policy inequalities that produce unequal environments and how those unequal environments contribute to public health disparities in St. Louis and beyond. We explore the use of public health data, policy options, and case studies that allow for evidence-based solutions to environmental racism and improved population health. This course that combines small group sessions, case studies and speakers working on environmental justice in the St. Louis region. We provide students with interdisciplinary perspectives and methods, challenging them to address racism and environmental policy through a population health lens. Student learning will be assessed through case studies, reflections, online assignments, and exams.

The course is designed to support MBG's Community Based Conservation Program sites, while building student understanding of challenges at the intersection of rural agricultural subsistence communities, climate change, and biodiversity hot spots. The course involves preparatory learning during the WUSTL spring semester and ongoing communication and collaboration with Malagasy community representatives during this period.  An additional lab credit option entails interactive research project deployment and monitoring on the ground in Madagascar during a summer window. MBG has been facilitating conservation work in Madagascar for over 40 years. Among these initiatives is a Community Based Conservation Program (CBCP) in Mahabo, a ten-community commune in southeastern Madagascar within a rare forest ecosystem. This commune is the most mature of MBG's eleven conservation sites, each of which share similar challenges for both biodiversity conservation and human wellbeing. Over several years MBG has established trusted relationships with rural Malagasy community members, building cooperation on community-specific, grassroots conservation efforts with indigenous communities. Such cooperation can be undermined by the forces of poverty, which compel communities to extract resources unsustainably from the sensitive forest. Therefore, the community-based conservation approach integrates a full understanding of the need for economic stability and health priorities alongside conservation of flora and fauna. Program targets range from forest conservation and use to nutrition, health, food security, clean water, and education. This course integrates study of biodiversity, poverty, and community-based conservation principles with research design, professional teamwork, and cultural competency skills. Through enrollment in this course and the optional subsequent field experience, students will select a focal area in community-based conservation, and build a robust understanding of a challenge in principle, as well as its specific manifestation in the Mahabo case.  They will engage with preexisting and/or collaboratively proposed on-the-ground initiatives in MBG's CBCP, develop a study design to assess the efficacy of these initiatives, and support iterative implementation.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_391","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Directed Research in Environmental Studies","catalogNumber":"ENST 3910","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ENST_391_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Kelling, Meredith Leigh"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[5,4]}]},"description":"Research activities or project in environmental studies done under the direction of an instructor in the Program.

Some leaders believe that the sole purpose of business is to maximize shareholder wealth and that fiscal sustainability is not compatible with environmental responsibility. In reality, ecological and economic performance need not--and should not--be mutually exclusive. Fortunately, the outmoded mindset of profit-at-any-cost is beginning to shift as organizations recognize the importance of adopting balanced business practices that promote social equity and environmental prosperity without sacrificing financial stability. Organizations that embed sustainability into their corporate strategies increase operational efficiency by using resources more responsibly and minimizing waste. In an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace, sustainability has become a source of competitive advantage through which an organization can have a positive impact not only on the financial bottom line but also on the environment and society. In this course, we explore key concepts and issues driving sustainability in business. We also examine core sustainability principles, frameworks, and tools that companies can use to better understand and work within the natural systems that enable their existence and sustain their operations.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_400","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Topics in Environmental Science","catalogNumber":"ENST 4000","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ENST_400_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Bowman, Katherine"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[9,15]}]},"description":"This topics course will address topics in Environmental Science.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_402","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Topics in Environmental Studies","catalogNumber":"ENST 4005","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355260","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Dodyk, Juan Andres"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[5,20]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355261","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Shen, Shiran Victoria"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[960,1130],"seats":[2,16]}]},"description":"Topic course, topic will varies by semester.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_210","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Undergraduate Teaching Assistant","catalogNumber":"ENST 2900","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338334","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Loui, Suzanne Jeanette"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,2]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-338362","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["VanRiper, Froggi"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,2]}]},"description":"In this course, an advanced undergraduate can assist a faculty member in the teaching of an introductory-level ENST course.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_ENST_375","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Environmental Studies","title":"Urban Ecology","catalogNumber":"ENST 3610","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_ENST_375_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[16,30]},{"id":"SEC_202602_ENST_375_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Parks, John W."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[29,30]}]},"description":"Urban Ecology is a field of study within ecology that focuses on the urban environment as an ecosystem and attempts to understand how humans and nature can better coexist in these highly modified environments.

We see such innovative narrative forms in Hollywood films such as Source Code (Duncan Jones, 2011), Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010), and Butterfly Effects (Eric Bress and J.Mackye Gruber, 2004), as well as in TV serials such as FlashForward (ABC, 2009-10) and Russian Doll (Netflix,2019), not to mention global art cinema Too Many Ways to Be No.1 (Wai Ka-fai, 1997) and Peppermint Candy (Chang Dong Lee, 1999). Named puzzle films, mind-game films, or complex TV, these films and series manifest common new features, such as non-linear narratives, jumbled chronologies, labyrinthine spatial orientation; they creatively use time travel, multiverse, compulsive repetition, and loops to transcend spatial-temporal limitations. These films play with our perception of the reality, present new psychological and cognitive challenges, and thereby create new spectatorial pleasure. This course teaches students to enjoy, view, closely analyze, and critically think about films and series of complex storytelling. Reading these films along with recent film and television studies scholarship, students learn analytical skills and conceptual frameworks to untangle the convoluted narrative logic and discern in the narrative architecture new modes of rethinking identity, reality, history, and future in our contemporary societies.

While the students fashion their screenwriting independently, the class will also explore the general elements of THEME, GENRE, and VOICE.  A more specific examination of mechanics, the nuts and bolts of story construction, plotting, pacing, etc. will follow to support the ongoing writing process.  In-class exercises will aid the writer in sharpening skills and discovering new approaches to form and content.  Writers' work will be shared and discussed regularly in class.

But early game-console hardware was designed with very particular ideas of what made a game a game, and under extreme constraints of cost and technical viability. Creators designed for these constraints, and their work then influenced the design of later hardware and software. This is a course about the history, design, and technology of one retro game console, the 1977 Atari Video Computer System (also known as the Atari VCS or the Atari 2600). The first popular home console, the Atari VCS is a truly weird computer: It boasts 128 bytes of RAM, no video buffer, and a custom graphics and sound chip designed to interface with then-universal cathode ray tube televisions. Against all odds, creators made fun and successful games within these extreme constraints. Just as an artist benefits from learning the fundamentals of their craft, so a game designer or developer can benefit from returning to these early and crude hardware platforms. In this course, students will learn the technical and creative history of the Atari, and they will also learn the fundamentals of programming its unfamiliar hardware. Students will carry out programming exercises, mostly in the assembly language instructions required to operate this unusual computer. They will then make their own games for the Atari, which will be able to run on the actual, 45-year-old hardware.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_FILM_5479","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Film and Media Studies","title":"Seminar in Interdisciplinary Approaches","catalogNumber":"FILM 5479","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-353582","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hilu, Reem Ghattas"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[4,20]}],"lab":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-353583","number":"A","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hilu, Reem Ghattas"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[1140,1320],"seats":[4,20]}]},"description":"This variable topics course is an interdisciplinary seminar on film/media designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.

But what it is ain't exactly clear…” begins the 1966 song entitled “For What It’s Worth” by Buffalo Springfield. The song, like many of the artists who made up Buffalo Springfield, were central to the tumultuous cultural changes of the 1960s in the United States. The long 1960s have been the inspiration for innumerous pieces of art, music, literature and scholarship across the globe. Representations of 1960s in mass media and popular culture have often simplified the period into a story of charismatic leaders and villains with less attention given to the diverse set of actors, politics, and responses. Certainly, the history of the 1960s includes both charismatic leaders and villainous actors but they also spurred the creation of new cultural forms and new politics which shattered a shaky American consensus. This course examines the history of the long 1960s through an exploration of the politics, counter-politics, cultural productions, and everyday life which captured a pivotal period of American history. Central to the story of the 1960s is the emergence of a large constituency which had been largely sidelined in political and social action in the previous generation—the youth. Universities, colleges, bookshops, bars, and music venues all became gathering places for more than just recreation or learning but for politics and pleasure which would help shape the second half of the 20th century. In this class we will explore those spaces, places, and peoples who shaped the long 1960s and continue to impact the ways in which political change happens and where we imagine power can come from.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_3166","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"A History of Modern China","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3287","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_HISTORY_3166_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Kuzuoglu, Ulug"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[38,40]}]},"description":"This course explores the 19th- and 20th-century history of China.

We then move on to the Qing's troubled relationship with Western capitalism and imperialism in the 19th century, which challenged the economic, social, and ideological structures of the imperial regime, culminating in the emergence of China as a nation-state. By situating China's national history within a global context, the course outlines in detail the transformations that took place in the 20th century, from the rise of communism and fascism to the Second World War to Maoism and cultural revolution.

How do modern historians use medieval documents to evoke the lives of men, women, and children who believed in magic or were accused of heresy? Can this only be done through a form of historical anthropology? What methods do historians use in trying to understand past ideas and practices? What is historical truth then?

It will begin in the fourth century after the conversion of Constantine the Great and end with the great witchcraft trials of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The seminar will read magical treatises, ecclesiastical polemics against vulgar belief, inquisitorial trials, chronicles, and histories, in our attempt to define what was considered the ordinary and the extraordinary, the natural and the supernatural, good and evil, the boundaries of heaven and earth. How do modern historians use medieval documents to evoke the lives of men, women, and children who believed in magic or were accused of heresy? Can this only be done through a form of historical anthropology? What methods do historians use in trying to understand past ideas and practices? What is historical truth then?

Although Chinese migration certainly existed beforehand, the period from the 16th century to the present day is marked by the emergence of sustained movement of non-state actors and the development of institutions -- ranging from native-place associations to tourist agents' websites -- that supported this vast circulation of people. Likewise, in many emigrant communities and host societies, Chinese diasporic families adapted to migration as a way of life.

Starting with the bold claim that foreign policy has played a central role in shaping American history, the course traces America’s evolution from a small colony to the world’s only hyperpower through sustained foreign policy to keep European powers at bay and then out of the Western Hemisphere, followed by continental expansion and outward expansion to reach the farthest corners of the globe. In particular, it surveys many government institutions, agencies, and departments, colorful (and dull) personalities, numerous policies, treaties and agreements, and a plethora of key events that have shaped US foreign relations over time. Primarily a course diplomatic history that examines American statecraft through government to government relations, the course reveals how political, economic and military events, especially wars, have influenced policy and determined outcomes. Along the way, we will also explore major themes such as republicanism, empire, liberty, and independence, as well as chestnuts of grand strategy such as isolationism vs. engagement, realism vs. liberalism, unilateral vs. multilateralism, soft vs. hard power, and idealism vs. pragmatism.

However, new hybrid forms of writing-from historical fiction, to docudramas, to fictionalized biographies-have led to the blurring of the boundary and encouraged the claim that history itself is just another form of fiction. At the same time, historical novelists have placed increasing emphasis on the authenticity, sometimes even the accuracy, of their narratives and characterizations. And further still, contemporary writers are challenging dominant historical narratives by creating plausible fictions from the perspectives of the subordinated, the marginalized and the disenfranchised: plebeians, women, and indigenous, enslaved, and diasporic peoples. As historical novels become ever more popular, the distinction between history and fiction appears to be collapsing before our eyes. Through reading and discussing some outstanding examples of the genre of historical fiction published between the early nineteenth and the early twenty-first century (from Walter Scott to Charles Dickens, from Toni Morrison to Amitav Ghosh, from Graham Swift to Hilary Mantel), this course will investigate whether history is 'factual' or just another form of fiction; whether the appeal of historical fiction should lie in its authenticity; whether the recent success of historical novels should be viewed as a new development, or rather, as a revival of an older literary tradition; and whether novelists and dramatists are more adept than historians at interrogating issues of memory, identity, and change.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-61956","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"Historical Methods- Modern United States History","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3383","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-354966","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Mustakeem, Sowande"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[7,15]}]},"description":"This is a small-group reading course in which students are introduced to the skills essential to the historian's craft.

On the record is a song called Dirty South. The track talks about life in the South highlighting the war on drugs, racism,  and stereotypes that people thought about Black southerners. That same year another Southern hip hop group, Outkast, won the best new hip hop award and brought widespread attention to the rap and hip-hop scene which had been dominated by East Coast and West Coast artists. A new generation of Southern music would quickly become the dominant form of hip hop we hear today. In the early albums you hear lines which ask what it means to be Southern, questions where the South is, and speaks of Southern culture. We will attempt to answer some of those questions that Goodie Mob, Outkast, and more recently Beyoncé posed through a historical exploration of a region steeped in mystery and mystique. The South has fascinated generations of Americans, often represented as a deeply divided and troubled area of backward peoples and histories which continue to shock the nation. At the same time, the South is home to more diverse peoples, businesses, foodstuffs, and geography than most of the United States. The South often defies expectations and surprises the most seasoned social scientist. This course will introduce students to the history of a place that is both familiar and strange while exploring difficult issues of race, ethnicity, and identity. Students will be exposed to a variety of sources including music, film, and art produced by and/or about Southerners. Students will walk away from this course with a deeper understanding of the diversity of cultures and histories of the South and question what makes the South exceptional.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_HISTORY_365","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"History","title":"The Birth Crisis of Democracy: The New United States of America, 1776-1850","catalogNumber":"HISTORY 3158","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-351311","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Bernstein, Iver"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[34,40]}]},"description":"Go get yourself some democracy!

For these scholars and activists, it is not up for debate whether someone can be queer and Jewish or queer and Muslim. Therefore, what follows is an exploration of how to resurrect gender non-conforming interpretations of religious texts and rediscover the spectrum of gender and sexual identities that have always existed within Judaism and Islam.  The course is divided into three parts. First, we will examine the religious textual traditions of both faiths to establish the space for queer identities in both the Qur'an and Torah as well as the traditions of Hadith and Talmud. Second, we will study key communities such as medieval Iberia, the Ottoman Mediterranean, Hasidic communities in Eastern Europe, Qajar Iran, and the colonial empires of  the Middle East. This survey will show the influence European christian dominance had (or did not have) on the evolution of jewish and islamic gender and sexual norms from pre-modern times through the 20th century. Finally, we will examine the 21st century by reading the memoirs of trans muslims and trans Jews in order to analyze the ways in which contemporary queer jewish and islamic individuals frame their experiences and tell their stories of faith with agency, in their own words.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_JIMES_2242","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies","title":"Ampersand: Migration Policies and Colonialism: Refugee Resettlement and Integration","catalogNumber":"JIMES 2242","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-354548","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Tarbouni, Younasse"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[22,25]}]},"description":"This Course will continue our investigation of the Dynamics of Migration in the MENA and African countries primarily and re-orient the discussions towards a/the much-overlooked cause of migration: Colonialism. To achieve genuine refugee/ Migrant oriented reform policies, the Global North needs to reconcile with its colonial past. Towards this end, we will highlight how the history of Migration is deeply entangled with colonialism.  Our readings-based discussions will focus on analyzing how colonial logics continue to shape the dynamics of migration as well as fuel the growing Xenophobia and Anti-migration rhetoric in the Global North towards intercontinental human mobility.  To understand the enduring legacies of colonialism on the contemporary politics of migration, our discussions will argue the premise that colonial histories should be central to migration studies today for there to be real reform in refugee, asylum, and migrant policies. We will explore a wide range of inspiring and challenging perspectives on migration and learn what postcolonial and decolonial scholarships can offer us studying international migration today. We will address these areas through our weekly readings of Migration Studies and Colonialism as a primary source; we will also survey a selection of articles as a secondary source. To supplement the readings, we will watch short documentaries addressing the topic as well as hear from activists, journalists, and specialists in the field.

These would be some of the main questions we willl address in this course.    Genre theory can teach us a fascinating history of how various cultures imagine their forms of creative expression. The development of genres and subgenres reveal complex histories on who has the power to define and redefine creative expression. For example, the novel, now a dominant and prestigious global literary genre, was once considered an inferior and working-class genre in Europe over a century ago. The novel genre then developed into numerous subgenres, which are today placed under one large umbrella that is genre-fiction, such as sci-fi, fantasy, horror, gothic, mystery etc.. However, the borders between these subgenres and the larger genre itself are always contested and reformulated. Through the history of genre and subgenre, we get to learn about literary taste and literary criticism, and whose definitions and conventions have changed the course of literature and the arts, and for what reason. The dominance of the historical novel today, for example, is attributed to larger phenomenon such as decolonization, feminism, and anti-racism. The sociopolitical urge to utilize fiction to address larger issues has not only boosted the impact of the historical novel but elevated it to become a common form of the genre itself.   Within this grand history, Arabic literature has a complex and rich story to tell about genre and subgenre. The most obvious example here, which will be our entry point in this course, is 1001 Nights (also known as The Nights, or The Arabian Nights). This multi-volumed masterpiece has influenced fiction writers across the globe, especially in the past three centuries as the novel began to formulate into a modern genre.

This dynamic, revolutionary, and mobile nature of The Nights expresses the meeting of various cultures, experiences, and traditions of storytelling during the Abbasid empire. Today, it remains ever more relevant and inspiring in a cosmopolitan world.    The question and history of sub/genre, however, will guide us through an exploration of modern and contemporary Arabic literature.

The aesthetic choices made in literature are never isolated from the intellectual, political, and sociohistorical contexts of a given text. Through the assigned texts and artworks, we will also learn about colonization, gender, imperialism, class, migration, ecology, among other pressing topics.

The six oil-rich countries (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman) have been allies of the United States for decades, hosting some of the U.S. largest military bases, and spending billions on US arms sales every year. The Gulf region has also been a main destination for blue-collar workers from the Arab world, South and East Asia, and more recently from Africa. Historically, the region was a central point on the trade routes between the Indian subcontinent, West Asia, Africa, and into Europe. These routes involved spice and tea trades, pearl and gold trade, and what is known as the Indian Ocean slave trade.  In addition to its colonial history and economic power, the Gulf region has become a place of cultural production, capital, and infrastructure, representing a shift away from the traditional centres of Arab culture like Egypt, Lebanon, and Iraq. It hosts remote campuses of western universities such as New York University Abu Dhabi, Georgetown Doha, or global branches of western arts institutions like the Louvre and Guggenheim. Moreover, most of the major literary and arts awards, funds, grants, and galleries in the Arabic-speaking world are now located in the Gulf region, established and funded as government initiatives.  Parallel to this growing infrastructure, the Gulf region is also a hub of ideas and movements where diverse groups come to critique and contest conceptions of identity, class, gender, and race, against official histories. This course will explore the following set of special topics to help us learn about the region, its politics, cultures, and societies: Petro-capitalism, Race and Ethnicity, Migration, Ecology, Gender and Sexuality, and Pop Culture. We will be studying the region through an interdisciplinary lens that involves fiction, non-fiction, literary criticism, scholarship, and visual arts.

Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy businesswoman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled. Specifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an other, against which and through which they define a particular sense of self?

Using data sets generated in the fall course, “Research Methodologies of Human Movement Science”, students in the spring semester will get hands-on experience analyzing and interpreting real data. Principles of statistical analysis, scientific communication, and ushering a paper to publication will be emphasized. One group project and one solo project will be accomplished throughout the semester.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_DRAMA_4082","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Advanced Theater for Social Change","catalogNumber":"DRAMA 4203","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_DRAMA_4082_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Pileggi, Annamaria"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,10]}]},"description":"This course is a continuation of exploration begun in Drama 4081, Theater for Social Change: a prerequisite for this advanced course.  Students will expand from exploring their own experience with oppression to facilitating that exploration with others.  Students will be introduced to the Joker system, developed by Brazilian director Augusto Boal. The Joker is the director of a forum theater event.  He leads both the exploration and play-making phases of the process.   In preparation for stepping into this role, students will read Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed which will give them a foundation in the power and efficacy of collaborative educational techniques.  In addition, students will read Theatre for Living, Canadian director David Diamond's book detailing his application of Boalian techniques in a less overtly oppressive society.   Students will begin their practical exploration by first working with one another, learning how to lead exercises and games, followed by an exploration of play making and the facilitation of an interactive forum theater event.   The course will culminate in an outside project in which each student is placed with a St. Louis area school or social organization.  The student will apply skills he has acquired throughout the semester by serving as the Joker of the workshop.  In this role, the student will lead the entirety of the workshop process with a selected group exploring ways of effecting positive social change in a theatrical context.  He will facilitate exercises with the group that mine a chosen area of oppression with which the group is grappling.  The student will guide play-making with the group that highlights this area of oppression.  The resulting plays will then be presented to the larger school or organization community.  This culminating event will be an interactive forum theater presentation that the student will lead as Joker.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_DRAMA_201","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Black Theater Workshop","catalogNumber":"DRAMA 2203","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_DRAMA_201_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Himes, Ronald J."],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[960,1040],"seats":[6,16]}]},"description":"The Black Theater Workshop is a performance-oriented course with an emphasis on literature by African American playwrights and writers.

Who could have ever thought that was realistic? Would time-travelers from the future think actors in our day appear just as ridiculous? If you've ever thought that thought, then you've stumbled onto the fact that-despite its claims to represent the reality of its audience's experiences with the verisimilitude of the actor's body in the here and now-acting is a historical practice. Moreover, it is a culturally-variable practice, with claims to represent the real that are both symbolic and mimetic, and usually both at once. In this course, we will trace the history of acting in five thematic units: rhetorical gestures; representing the collective; festive formations; signs, codes, and animated hieroglyphs; and approaching the real. From the ancient Greeks to digital avatars, we will study how bodies in motion create meanings for their audiences in different cultures and across time. Through kinesthetic, emotional, psychological, and visceral appeals, actors not only represent their audiences as they think they are, but also offer to transform them into whom they think they could be.  This course fulfills the historical practice requirement in the Drama major/minor.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_DRAMA_4310","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Borders and Boundaries","catalogNumber":"DRAMA 4311","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_DRAMA_4310_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Pena, Elaine"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon"],"time":[960,1130],"seats":[4,10]}]},"description":"International borders affect you every day. In the United States and elsewhere, they play a role in determining whether you are a birthright citizen or an unauthorized migrant. They showcase a nation's ability or inability to guarantee your wellbeing. They factor into immigration, asylum, and national security debates. Those who live near an international border often deal with a particular set of issues. Living in an either/or environment can impel border residents to strategically recognize or deny cultural forms-to be hyper patriotic, for example, to speak one language at home and another at school, or to understand gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity in site-specific ways. This course will draw from the work of performance theorists, playwrights, anthropologists, historians, and geographers to write critically about and devise artistic work that opens up foundational theories, debates, and genealogies in the study of borders and boundaries.

How do the affordances of a digital tool amplify or suppress aspects of a source story? What new insights into familiar stories can we generate with radical adaptation? To engage these questions, this studio seminar blends humanistic scholarship with critical making, theatrical practice, and interdisciplinary, team-based agile development processes. Each two-week sprint engages a different immersive, theatricalized context, asking students to envision how the tools utilized therein might illuminate latent aspects of familiar stories. Topics include spatial computing/AR/VR/ XR, immersive theatre, theme parks, and cultural institutions/ museums. Additionally, this course utilizes critical making as an epistemology, wherein the site of knowledge creation is the process of devising an object, tool, performance, or installation in conversation with a discipline's critical apparatus. Accordingly, course-long projects will find students selecting and using immersive tools-digital, analog, or both-to radically adapt a familiar story, broadly construed.

The course does not intend to train the student as a dancer or actor, but it maintains that the successful speaker would do well to harness some of the transferable skill sets from these disciplines.  The speaker, like the performer, must stand before an audience with an objective to communicate something well.  Both should be dedicated advocates for the message.

This course will examine the many types of revision that are deployed as part of theatrical practice. Using works from several genres, media, cultures, and time periods as case studies, we will gain new insights into the creative process by charting the amendments made not only during the various stages of the play's initial production--its composition, its rehearsals, its workshops, and its early performances-but also the more significant modifications adopted by subsequent adaptations and revivals. We will discuss plays that are rewritten in order to reflect new historical contexts and audience sensibilities, paying special attention to revisions that engage with emergent social and political realities. We will also emphasize the repossession that occurs as new productions seek to include a greater diversity of racial and gender identities. We will also consider the revisions enabled by technological innovations as well as those necessitated by translation in global productions.

It is perhaps for this reason that Shakespeare's work has continued to shape subsequent theatrical and film productions. This course will examine the recent adaptations of Shakespeare's work that have originated on the Broadway stage and in Hollywood movie studios. We will look at the many alterations that were made to Shakespeare's original plays from shifted settings to changes to the characters' ages and vocations to the addition of music to modernized dialogue. We will consider how these modern adaptations link the early modern period with our own by examining how these theatrical and film productions build upon the plays' engagements with love and family as well as the social issues of race, gender, and social class. We will also draw a connection between these adaptations and Shakespeare's own creative practice of crafting his plays by revising earlier source materials. Most importantly, we think about how these adaptations simultaneously make Shakespeare's plays more accessible and current for a contemporary audience while also serving to certify the timelessness of these stories.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_DANCE_499","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Performing Arts","title":"Study for Honors","catalogNumber":"DANCE 4930","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_DANCE_499_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Marchant, David W."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202602_DANCE_499_04_S","number":"04","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Slaughter, Cecil L."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,1]},{"id":"SEC_202602_DANCE_499_05_S","number":"05","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Das, Joanna Dee"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":null}]},"description":"An honors thesis or performance and thesis project designed by the student, and supervised and assessed by a faculty committee.

In part two, we explore theoretical frameworks of motor learning as they pertain to movement. We delve into the neuromechanisms underlying common tools that dancers and athletes use to improve motor performance and how dance training induces neuroplasticity in brain structure and function. In part three, we explore the neural underpinnings of aesthetic appreciation while watching dance, including the action observation network and affective responses to art.

As Bernard Williams has written,It is pointless to ask who is the world’s greatest philosopher: for one thing there are many differentways of doing philosophy. But we can say what the various qualities of great philosophers are:intellectual power and depth; a grasp of the sciences; a sense of the political, and of humandestructiveness as well as creativity; a broad range and a fertile imagination; an unwillingness tosettle for the super>icially reassuring; and, in an unusually lucky case, the gifts of a great writer. If weask which philosopher has, more than any other, combined all these qualities—to that question thereis certainly an answer, Plato. (“Plato: The Invention of Philosophy,” in The Sense of the Past, ed. M.F.Burnyeat [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2006], pp. 148-186, at 179-180)Accordingly, as we try to come to grips with Plato, we will be trying to come to grips with philosophy itself, how to do it.This semester, the centerpiece will be, as it must be, Plato’s Republic, the core of which is a question of ethics but which also includes important speculation about politics, psychology, general ontology, epistemology, and aesthetics. But we will also have a thematic focus, to track Plato’s conception of philosophical ethics, that is, how Plato thinks about how to settle how a person should live. (How!) Plato inherited from Socrates an obsession with the question of how we should live, and he inherited from Socrates the broad answer that we must be philosophers to live well. But how exactly are we supposed to philosophize, and how exactly is that supposed to help us live well? We will set up these questions (and start trying to answer them) by studying the Apology of Socrates, the Euthydemus, and Diotima’s teaching in the Symposium, before we turn to the Republic. Then, after we have followed the Republic’s wide-ranging tour, we will tackle the Philebus, which extends Plato’s re>lections on pleasure, knowledge, and the good life.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_PHIL_131F","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Philosophy","title":"Present Moral Problems","catalogNumber":"PHIL 1060","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_PHIL_131F_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Baril, Anne Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[17,30]},{"id":"SEC_202602_PHIL_131F_02_S","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Baril, Anne Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[21,30]},{"id":"SEC_202602_PHIL_131F_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Brown, Eric"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[510,590],"seats":[24,45]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-361874","number":"04","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Baril, Anne Marie"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[20,25]}]},"description":"An investigation of a range of contemporary moral issues and controversies that draws on philosophical ethics and culturewide moral considerations.

Some areas to be explored:  1. Can consciousness be addressed like any other biological property in the sense that it has evolved by natural selection and that some elements of it are present in simple model systems, such as the fruit fly?  Can insight be gained studying simple model systems? 2. Where in the brain is consciousness?  What is the pattern of neurological events that occurs during consciousness?  Is brain activity generating consciousness localized or distributed?  Does it involve interacting brain regions?  Does brain activity generating consciousness migrate to different brain regions? 3. How does the dynamic core hypothesis of Edelman relate to these questions?  What can functional brain imaging add to these questions?  Are Gamma waves involved in higher mental activity, and do they promote synchronized firing of neurons from different brain areas?  How does this relate to the binding problem? 4. How does the brain's ability to function as a computer relate to consciousness? In many respects the brain functions as a computer using electrical signals called Action Potentials.  Action potentials in neuronal networks function in an analogous was as DC electrical impulses function in computer circuits.  What is the output of computation in an electrical device?  What are the theoretical limitations regarding what computation can achieve and ask whether electrical activity in the brain also has a fundamentally different purpose in addition to computation. 5.  Is our knowledge of the physical world too primitive and incomplete to understand consciousness?  The brain is an electronic device and consciousness clearly depends on its electrical activity.  Yet, electrical forces are poorly understood, both in the context of classical physics and quantum physics.  Will understanding consciousness have to wait for a unified theory that more accurately describes electrical forces?  Prerequisites: Bio3411 or equivalent.  College level physics, Some knowledge of computers.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_PE_216","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Physical Education","title":"Soccer","catalogNumber":"PE 2060","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_PE_216_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring Intersession","instructor":["Bordelon, Andrew"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[600,680],"seats":[20,22]}]},"description":"Designed to develop an appreciation for soccer through the development of soccer skills, concepts of group play and team competition.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_PE_239","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Physical Education","title":"Topics in Physical Education: Beginning Tennis","catalogNumber":"PE 2039","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_PE_239_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring Intersession","instructor":["Pereira, Jessica","Lenz, Bryan J"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[780,860],"seats":null}]},"description":"Eight-week course: Start 3/1-4/28.

The approach is that of an upper-division physics course, with more emphasis on the underlying formal structure, rather than breadth of topics. The main goal is to provide an in-depth coverage of electromagnetism, DC and AC circuits using complex variables, and optics.

Astrophysics is the study of the planets, the Sun and other stars, the Milky Way Galaxy and the other galaxies, the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium, and the Universe itself. This study is aided by our knowledge of the laws of Physics discovered by experiments carried out in laboratories, and astronomical observations have often revealed new fundamental laws of Physics. This course will begin by covering the motions of the Sun and the Moon as we see them across the sky, the structure of the Solar System, and the search for exoplanets orbiting other stars. Then we will jump discussing the Milky Way galaxy, active galaxies with growing supermassive black holes, quasars, and how galaxies assemble in clusters of galaxies that form the cosmic web. Finally, we will describe our current knowledge of the matter, radiation, and energy content of the Universe as well as its birth, evolution, and fate. In class, we will also discuss fascinating topics, like the telescopes that enable us to study the universe using radio waves, X-ray and gamma-ray photons, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. The purpose of the course is to kindle your interest in Astrophysics and Cosmology and to prepare you for their more detailed study in upper-level courses.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_PHYSICS_594","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Physics","title":"Introduction to Methods in Physics","catalogNumber":"PHYSICS

From fairy tales to bestsellers, legends of oral tradition to trend-setting points in the U.S. and global literary marketplace, they are the stories that win. These stories are rooted in a collective literary imagination that binds individual and community hopes + struggles. They are novels, or memoirs of political coming of age, tales of creative sparks that have led to iconic global brands and products, or narrative analyses that become collective origin stories. They speak to the relationship between expectations of justice and our varied political identities; they provide communal reference points during marked moments in history. These stories win by transcending the limits of time or through the entanglements of commercial success. This semester we delve into political memoirs; origin stories of athletes, iconic products, and CEOs; community narrative histories; fairy tales; and myths of national beginnings. We want to understand how power and the uses of history are central to making certain stories, especially origin stories, the ones public figures deploy to represent their identity, the stories we as a nation tell about ourselves over and over, and the ones that become our collective points of reference-that is, the stories that win.

We will cover the fundamentals of how political scientists are able to draw causal inferences. To do so, we will review basic probability and statistics. We will then discuss the types of inferences possible with different data-generating processes, including laboratory experiments, randomized field experiments, and observational data.

In this course, we will examine the political conditions that forcibly displace people across and within countries including persecution, conflict, and environmental disasters exacerbated by climate change as well as their experiences of seeking refuge. How do international, state, local, and non-governmental institutions cooperate to manage the needs of forcibly displaced persons? In what ways do political pressures create opportunities for and barriers to effective policies to address refugee issues? How do these structural challenges affect forcibly displaced persons, and what strategies do advocates use to improve the human rights of these populations?

Our goal is instead to examine how selected cutting-edge formal tools can illuminate questions at the core of comparative politics, especially in settings where institutions are weak, politics is contested, and collective action is fragile. The course is organized around theoretical frameworks rather than substantive topics or regions. Each section pairs a “pure” theoretical paper (usually from economics) with an application in political science. The theory papers are demanding, but they represent the frontier of the modeling toolkit; the applied pieces demonstrate how these tools can be used to generate insights about autocracy, protest, representation, and democratic backsliding. Students are not expected to master every proof, but they are expected to engage the frameworks critically and think about how they might adapt them in their own work.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"COURSE_DEFINITION-3-62152","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"Gender, Sex, and Political Theory","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 5167","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-355425","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Vedder, Ophelia"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue"],"time":[870,1040],"seats":[4,20]}]},"description":"This course offers graduate students an overview of topics in feminist political theory.

The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the  evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts.  This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation literacy that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that literacy include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_POLSCI_3110","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Political Science","title":"Money in Politics","catalogNumber":"POLSCI 3110","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-350937","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Motolinia Carballo, Lucia"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[870,950],"seats":[46,50]}]},"description":"Money and politics are inextricably linked.

This course aims to introduce policy-oriented students to how Constitutional interpretation touches upon pressing policy questions. Students will engage with what courts expect to see from policymakers, while also learning how to read cases from a lawyer's perspective. Topics covered include federalism, LGBT rights, race and ethnicity, criminal justice issues, voting rights, and political questions and official immunity. Texts will include cases decided by the Supreme Court (including cases from recent terms), and also contemporary scholarship on judicial politics and decision making. Although our focus will be on the Supreme Court, the pedagogical emphasis will be on what policy makers can expect from the courts in terms of federal and state policy implementation. Our goal is that by the end of this course you will be able to: 1. Understand when federal courts will and will not intervene, particularly with regard to key policy and political issues 2. Think critically and assess the ability of courts to be used as instruments of social change 3. Understand what oversight, if any, the courts exercise over federal policy making, including by administrative agencies The course content is divided into four broad units, all of which are essential for understanding the courts' role in the promotion and interpretation of national policy. These are (1) federal courts, their nature, and their limited powers, (2) the courts' role in social movements and as protectors of individual rights and liberties, (3) political questions and immunity, and (4) the complicated relationship between courts and administrative agencies.

Drawing on work by Glenn Stone and others, we explore the social and ecological shortcomings of this model and the promise of agroecological alternatives—often developed by Indigenous and smallholder farmers themselves.We then shift our focus to the politics of food and health in the United States. Through readings by Julie Guthman, Natalie Boero, and Gyorgy Scrinis, we interrogate how fatphobia, the concept of an \"obesity epidemic,\" and reductive nutritionist ideologies have shaped American food and health discourse—often in ways that reinforce social inequality and benefit corporate interests. Finally, we investigate how these paradigms travel globally, with a focus on Guatemala, Malawi, the Philippines, Ghana, and West Papua. We consider how global development projects and interventions (e.g., GMOs, nutrition education) interact with local foodways and sociopolitical dynamics. Through this, students will come to understand that hunger and malnutrition are often political problems—rooted in inequality, dispossession, and systemic violence—rather than simply technical ones.

Why would such a translation be helpful, and to whom?

We will explore the creative and versatile ways in which Spanish American writers  and artists make use of existing aesthetic paradigms-such as magical realism, literary gothic, fairy tales, science  fiction, surrealism, film noir, and detective  fiction, among others-as they adapt them to the diverse political, economic and socio-cultural realities of their countries. In many of these discourses, overarching themes of imagination, dreams, madness, criminality, and  metaphysical search become intertwined with gendered  sensibilities and heterogeneous perspectives profoundly embedded in socio-political realities. Some of the mysteries and crimes that often elude detection and punishment have to do with corruption and state-sanctioned violence, as it happens in the cases of systemic violence in Colombia, of the plight of the disappeared persons under the dictatorial regimes of the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile), or the systemic corruption surrounding narcotrafficking.

The course thus explores the various ways in which the field of Global Hispanic Studies today connects with closely related areas of scholarly inquiry, such as Transatlantic Studies, Transpacific Studies, Hemispheric Studies, Mediterranean Studies, Third World/ Global South Studies, African Diaspora Studies, Migration Studies (including Exile), and World Literature. The seminar is structured into a series of different sub-sections that aims as a whole to frame the field of Global Hispanic Studies as an interdisciplinary and transnational area of scholarship and research. This format combines the analysis of important critical and theoretical readings (by authors such as Adam Lifshey for Transpacific Studies, Boaventura de Sousa Santos for the Global South, or Pascale Casanova for World Literature), with the close reading of a series of primary texts central to the overall field of Global Hispanic Studies across different historical periods. Examples of these central works include literature of the Sephardic diaspora or written in Ladino, Transatlantic avant-garde poetics and networks (César Vallejo, Vicente Huidobro, Silvina Ocampo); Hemispheric Literature during the modernist period (José Martí, Gabriela Mistral), and the Cold War (Neruda, Ernesto Cardenal, Elena Garro); contemporary literature produced by various exiled, and immigrant or first-generation writers (Max Aub, Najat El Hachmi); cultural production related to the African Diaspora across time (cultural forms by Afro-descendant communities across Latin America, the poetry of Nicolás Guillén, and Raquel Ilonbé); or the work of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Miguel de Cervantes, or Roberto Bolaño as World Literature.

Marinetti's Futurist Manifesto (1909), we read artistic responses that range from exaltation to dissent: Zola's The Human Beast; Apollinaire's Calligrammes and Cendrars's Prose of the Trans-Siberian. Visual units explore paintings (Monet; Sonia Delaunay), photographs (Germaine Krull), and early film/theory (Ge1maine Dulac), with a coda on slower temporalities (Francis Ponge, Chantal Akerman). We foreground questions of gender, labor, empire, and ethics: who benefits from \"time saved,\" who bears its costs, and how do forms encode ideology?

To examine how notions of the ideal worker shape and are shaped by gender, sexuality, and race, we will study various forms of work, including care work and reproductive labor; affective and emotional labor; migrant labor; service work; and sex work. Considering what is new and old about late (or neoliberal) capitalism, we will explore how the relationship between citizenship, the state and political economy has shifted over the last four decades. Across each of these registers, we will engage thinkers spanning Marxist feminist, radical feminist, liberal feminist, indigenous feminist, Black feminist, and disability justice traditions. We will ask how these interwoven genealogies grapple with U.S. imperialism and the relationship between race, class, and patriarchy, while mapping out various visions of solidarity economies, internationalism, and anti-work politics.

Science and scientific practice are commonly understood to proceed from a neutral, objective perspective aimed at producing universal truths. Similarly, technological innovation is understood to be an unquestioned good for human development. Feminist and queer thinkers have critiqued these views along epistemological, methodological, and socio-political lines. They have consistently pointed to both the gaps in scientific knowledge production and the risks of uncritical technological development for reproducing marginalization and oppression. At the same time, feminist and queer thinks have critically imagined the possibilities of both science and technology as potential forces for addressing social injustice. We will survey a number of these interventions while considering how this work might inform our present contexts.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (for women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

From hygienic campaigns against Mexican immigrants in early-1900s California to the 1991 quarantine of Haitian refugees with HIV at Guantanamo Bay, race and sexuality have proven crucial to how society identifies health and, by extension, determines who is fit to be a citizen. This interdisciplinary course interrogates the intersections of race, sexuality, and medicine, discussing how each domain has been constitutive of the other in the American context. Via feminist and queer theorizing, we will examine the political and economic factors under which diseases, illnesses, and health campaigns have impacted racial and sexual minorities over the last two centuries. An orienting question for the course is the following: How has the state wielded public health as a regulatory site to legitimatize perceived racial differences and to regulate ostensible sexual deviations? Through primary and secondary sources, we will likewise explore the various forms of health activism undertaken by these very same targeted populations. Themes to be addressed will include the medicalization of racial and sexual difference; activism both in and against health institutions; and the roles of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability in contemporary health issues. Case studies include the Tuskegee syphilis experiment; the sterilization of black, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American women; the medicalization of homosexuality during the Cold War; and the role of mass incarceration in the diffusion of HIV. At a moment in time when access to health continues to be shaped by categories of social difference, understanding the role of public health in the normalization and subversion of racial and sexual hierarchies in the West is more pertinent than ever.","level":"Undergraduate"},{"id":"CRS_WGSS_360","school":"Arts & Sciences","department":"Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies","title":"Trans Studies","catalogNumber":"WGSS 3500","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_WGSS_360_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Kimoto, Tamsin"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed"],"time":[780,860],"seats":[14,20]}]},"description":"This course surveys the interdisciplinary field of trans studies by emphasizing how trans identities, activism, and scholarship are intertwined with broader histories of gender, sexuality, race, disability, and class.

Engineers and inventors can make real and rapid improvements to patient treatments, length of hospital stay, procedure time, cost containment, and accessibility to treatment. However, a successful transition from idea to implementation requires careful market analysis and strategy planning. This course will address the steps in this process, including personal and team strength assessement, medical need validation, brainstorming initial solutions, market analysis, solution evaluation, regulatory, patent, and intellectual property concerns, manufacturability, risk assessment and mitigation, and global considerations. Students will be expected to review resource material prior to coming to class in order to facilitate active class discussion and team-based application of the material during class; regular attendance will be key to course success. The course will focus on applying product development techniques to several real unmet medical needs; students will thus perform analysis and create reports and presentations for several different product solutions. Peer and faculty evaluations will provide feedback to improve individual technique.

Traditionally, these topics are spread out over many physics/chemistry/engineering courses that take many semesters to cover.

Students enrolling in this course should have a knowledge of general chemistry.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_EECE-E44_200","school":"McKelvey School of Engineering","department":"Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering","title":"Independent Study","catalogNumber":"EECE 2999","units":null,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_03_S","number":"03","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Axelbaum, Richard L."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_05_S","number":"05","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ehrhard, Raymond Albert"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_07_S","number":"07","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Giammar, Daniel Edward"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_08_S","number":"08","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Parker, Kimberly"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_10_S","number":"10","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ling, Fangqiong"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_12_S","number":"12","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Jun, Young-Shin"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_14_S","number":"14","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Turner, Jay R"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_17_S","number":"17","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Bai, Peng"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_20_S","number":"20","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Brennan, Janie"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_22_S","number":"22","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Tang, Yinjie"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-353005","number":"23","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Kumfer, Benjamin M."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_24_S","number":"24","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Ramani, Vijay"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_28_S","number":"28","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Silbaugh, Trent Leonard"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_29_S","number":"29","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Foston, Marcus B."],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_31_S","number":"31","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Zhang, Fuzhong"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_32_S","number":"32","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Chakrabarty, Rajan K"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]},{"id":"SEC_202602_EECE-E44_200_33_S","number":"33","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Thimsen, Elijah James"],"delivery":"In-Person","time":null,"seats":[0,5]}]},"description":"Independent investigation on topic of special interest.

Properties of metallic materials are determined by their microstructure, which in turn is determined by their compositions and processing paths. An understanding of the multivariate relationships among compositions, processing parameters, microstructures, and properties is therefore essential to designing alloys and predicting their behavior in service. This course will discuss these relationships, with emphasis on the hierarchy of microstructural features, how they are achieved by processing, and how they interact to provide desirable property combinations -- essentially the physical metallurgy of alloys. The discussion will be based on examples from alloys used in airframes, engines, and automobiles and on their design for state-of-the-art processes such as additive manufacturing.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_MEMS_4301","school":"McKelvey School of Engineering","department":"Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science","title":"Modeling, Simulation and Control","catalogNumber":"MEMS 4320","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_MEMS_4301_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Karunamoorthy, Swami"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[720,770],"seats":null},{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-353958","number":"02","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Manzoor, Afaque"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Mon","Wed","Fri"],"time":[900,960],"seats":[43,80]}]},"description":"Introduction to simulation and control concepts.

While the course typically focuses on the creation and defense of profits, you can—and we will—apply all of the tools that we study to non-profit contexts. While we adopt the perspective of a high level manager, strategy cannot be the domain of top managers alone. In particular, functional specialists and mid-level managers—the starting positions of many MBAs—must understand the organization’s overall strategy when confronting day-to-day issues. Our aim is to increase your ability to assume a leadership role in your organization, no matter your formal position. We will do this by cultivating your ability to make well-grounded and insightful recommendations as to how your organization should be competing.  This course is primarily taught through the case method. We will supplement the case discussions with in-class games and exercises, discussions of current events, and out-of-class writing assignments. There are, of course, no easy answers regarding how a particular organization can formulate and implement strategy. My objective is for you to develop your own personal synthesis and approach for identifying and addressing key issues.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_FIN-B52_400J","school":"Olin Business School","department":"","title":"Advanced Valuation","catalogNumber":"FIN 4010","units":1,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"SEC_202602_FIN-B52_400J_01_S","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring Half A","instructor":["Sarkar, Sakya"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Tue","Thu"],"time":[690,770],"seats":[37,49]}]},"description":"This course covers advanced topics in valuation.

Most successful managers are able to incorporate and capitalize on the diversity of their employee population. However, by its nature, diversity means that we have different points of view, different values, different understandings and ways of knowing, different cultures and nationalities, and different ideas about how to measure and implement success and other factors in our organizations. Failure to incorporate and value those diverse voices can lead to conflict, negative press, turnover and poor performance in organizations and leave us paralyzed. Alternatively, we can capitalize on our diversity instead of letting it divide us. In so doing, we incorporate more points of view in our thought processes, consider novel alternatives, enhance creativity and performance, and incorporate all of our human assets by focusing on the basic values of equity, equality and inclusion. In this course, we will explore the impact of diverse organizational and multicultural contexts, with topics relevant to the workplace and our interactions, perceptions, and outcomes by exploring difference in terms of nationality, ethnicity, age, cultural values, gender differences, sexual orientation and different abilities. We take an interdisciplinary approach to the topic of diversity and inclusion. We will highlight diversity, equity and inclusion from the perspective of areas within business, law, and sociology. As we cover each topic area, we will juxtapose specific business practices and their impact (or lack thereof) on members of a diverse organization. We will also attend to the impact of different perspectives in terms of how business practices may be viewed by diverse employees, customers and stockholders. Our agenda will be accomplished in discipline-specific segments, where we examine a specific topic/business practice and its impact on various constituencies, identities and organizational outcomes.

Kahn was one of the most influential of the second generation of Modern architects, and this course will explore the architectural ordering principles structuring his work, how these were often derived from Kahn's perceptions regarding the works of his predecessors, and the manner in which these ordering principles have been employed by contemporary architects. Analytical methods employed in the course will cover that full range of contextual, cultural, material, constructive, and experiential attributes of buildings, with particular emphasis on Kahn's focus on the manner in which the spaces of a building are ordered by the patterns of occupation and the poetics of use, as well as the poetics of construction, or the way in which a building is built, and of what materials it is made, and how all these combine to construct the experience of those who inhabit it. Following introductory lectures by the faculty, each of the subsequent ten class meetings will consist of a presentation of a selected pair of buildings, one by Kahn and one by a contemporary architect, to be presented by teams of two students.

Such approaches fragment ecological understanding by reducing plants to memorized lists, erasing cultural and ecological diversity, disregarding diverse student perspectives, and failing to prepare future designers for global practice. As a result, students often struggle to comprehend plants as integral to global environmental systems, overlooking evolutionary histories and ancestral ties. These approaches ignore colonialism’s impact on plant knowledge, perpetuating disruptions of lifecycles and contributing to the displacement and reintroduction of species reshaping ecosystems and cultural connections.This course instead fosters a critical holistic critical understanding of plants, emphasizing systems across scales. It integrates Indigenous knowledge, enabling students to deconstruct colonial learning, rethink plants beyond taxonomies, and contextualize plant names within territories, and cultural significance. Through lectures, research, and storytelling, students will explore plants’ roles in soil, water, food systems, medicine, making, and construction, as well as their role in climate resilience and ecological restoration. Guest lecturers, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, will share direct experience working with plants.A core outcome of the course is for students to build a collective, living archive database of plant profiles integrating functions, cultural uses, and interactions.

The homogenization of global architectural values, under the guise of modernity, has undermined the cultural legacies that protected local and traditional building practices to the extent that many such practices are at risk of being lost forever. The Promiscuous Project utilizes generative AI's ability to disassociate from the imposed socio-political hierarchy of history to mine underexplored architectural qualities tied to cultural practices and hybridize them, drawing unexpected threads across time and space. In an increasingly mobile world, cultures are often practiced far from where they originate and are constantly evolving in response to their surroundings. This course seeks to parallel this cultural transgression in architectural production. This iteration of the seminar will focus on the cultural, architectural, and religious significance of domes in well-known Gothic churches like Notre Dame in France and lesser-known Persian and Ottoman mosques like the Shah Mosque in Iran.

But due to the infusion of political will and large amounts of money, they also involved the design and construction of enormous numbers of buildings all at once - resulting in the creation of small cities with their own infrastructure of utilities, waste disposal, police departments, hospitals and power plants.  The best architects and engineers of each era were called upon, sometimes in official competitions, to design and build innovative structures that expanded the use of materials and utilized engineering solutions which affected the built environment of the world.  The 1893 Chicago World's Fair alone changed the way Americans looked at cities and started the City Beautiful Movement.  Many architects designed influential pavilions at world's fairs, including Eliel Saarinen, Alvar Aalto, Oscar Niemeyer, Mies Van Der Rohe, Philip Johnson, Eero Saarinen, Frei Otto, Moshe Safdie, Kenzo Tange, Thomas Heatherwick, Norman Foster and Buckminster Fuller.  Today still-standing legacies of these fairs, including the Eiffel Tower, the Seattle Space Needle, the Montreal Biosphere, Habitat '67 and Zaha Hadid's Bridge Pavilion remind us of past glories.  World's Fairs are not relics of the past, but continue to be held today, involving architectural firms in master planning, pavilion design and exhibit creation on a massive scale.    Students will be expected to make short 10-15 minute presentations to the class on local sites at assigned times over the course of the term.  Other class requirements include regular attendance and class participation in discussions that demonstrate awareness of the required readings.  There will also be a short paper at the beginning of the semester and a 15-page final research paper.  For this paper students will be expected to document, critically analyze and draw conclusions about a building, structure or landscape at a world's fair.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_517S","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"What Does the Museum Look Like?

This seminar aims to shed light on this typology and the role that museum architecture has as a mechanism to activate present-day communities.  Students will conduct research through this type of contemporary culture condenser, which keeps digitalization and globalization. It will also consider the idea that a museum is not only a display or receptacle dedicated to established areas or disciplines such as the arts, science, sports, and industry, among others.  The research methodology will analyze and deploy seminal case studies to revisit and propose alternatives for the Museum's evolution as an architectural device for contemporary culture.  The course will address and discuss different topics such as the idea of destabilizing the Museum as an institution, dealing with conflict as a positive, alternative way to generate content, and thinking about this typology as a place mainly dedicated to positive interaction, discussion, service and exchange within the community.  To compare and acquire a global perception of a constellation of museum types, specific graphic standards will be used to represent the analysis and deployment of case studies. These analyses, as well as the results of the discussions and pieces of work produced during the seminar, could result in a small publication.","level":"Graduate"},{"id":"CRS_ARCH_528V","school":"Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts","department":"College of Architecture","title":"Women in Architecture","catalogNumber":"ARCH 5461","units":3,"sections":{"lecture":[{"id":"COURSE_SECTION_DEFINITION-3-352292","number":"01","term":"2026 Spring","instructor":["Hauk, Michelle"],"delivery":"In-Person","days":["Wed"],"time":[510,680],"seats":null}]},"description":"This research seminar will examine how women have shaped the field of architecture as practitioners, critics, researchers, and clients over the last two centuries, situating their work and their ideas within the canon of modern architecture through diverse historical and theoretical frameworks.It will trace the genealogical threads of key female figures in relation to international schools of thought, exploring the ways in which they contributed to the representation and production of space in the modern world.This seminar will also examine feminine discourses that both converged with and diverged from the dominant discourses of the field in order to shed light on the historical and cultural contexts that defined women's roles as architects and as consumers of architecture.
